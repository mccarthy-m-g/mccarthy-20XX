# Introduction

A central goal of modern neuroscience is to identify the neural causes of variation in human behaviour and cognition by characterizing how whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals under a variety of conditions [@duboisadolphs_BuildingScienceIndividual_2016; @spornsetal_HumanConnectomeStructural_2005; @vanessenetal_HumanConnectomeProject_2012; see also, @saucematzel_CausesVariationLearning_2013]. The synchronization of neural oscillations between spatially separate brain regions to form functional networks is considered a key mechanism by which the brain transmits and processes information [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @buzsakidraguhn_NeuronalOscillationsCortical_2004; @garrettetal_MomenttomomentBrainSignal_2013; @schnitzlergross_NormalPathologicalOscillatory_2005], and studying individual differences in the strength and pattern of connectivity in these functional networks is thought to be necessary for answering long-standing questions about behaviour and cognition in neuroscience [e.g., @viola_PlatonicBrainFacing_2020], psychology [e.g., @mcfarland_HowNeuroscienceCan_2017], and medicine [e.g., @grattonetal_DefiningIndividualSpecificFunctional_2020].[^1] Large and small scale efforts are now being made to characterize how whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals [for examples of large scale efforts, see @alexanderetal_OpenResourceTransdiagnostic_2017; @vanessenetal_HumanConnectomeProject_2012; for examples of small scale efforts, see @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @poldracketal_LongtermNeuralPhysiological_2015], and it is anticipated that the results of these efforts will lead to more robust, replicable, and meaningful accounts of human behaviour and cognition, and their dysfunction [@elliottetal_WhatTestRetestReliability_2020; @fedorenko_EarlyOriginsGrowing_2021; @mareketal_ReproducibleBrainWideAssociation_2020; cf. @mehlerkording_LureMisleadingCausal_2020; cf. @slomanetal_CognitiveNeuroscienceMeets_2021]. Although currently in its infancy, such an approach is already providing complimentary information to the group-level approaches conventionally used in human neuroscience research because of its increased sensitivity and resolution [for a brief overview, see @fedorenko_EarlyOriginsGrowing_2021], and reliability and interpretability [@elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018].

Given the promise of these efforts, it is unsurprising to see individual-level approaches being used to investigate how whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals [@demuruetal_FunctionalEffectiveWhole_2017; @garrettetal_MomenttomomentBrainSignal_2013; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @laumannetal_StabilityBOLDFMRI_2017; @miranda-dominguezetal_ConnectotypingModelBased_2014; @mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021; @vandevilleetal_WhenMakesYou_2021; @zanescoetal_BetweenpersonCorrelatesTemporal_2020], behave across different timescales [@betzeletal_IndividualizedEventStructure_2021; @vandevilleetal_WhenMakesYou_2021], change across the lifespan [@chanetal_DecreasedSegregationBrain_2014; @chanetal_LongtermPrognosisEducational_2021; @dosenbachetal_PredictionIndividualBrain_2010], respond to changing conditions [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021], predict differences in behaviour and cognition [@finnetal_FunctionalConnectomeFingerprinting_2015; @finnetal_CanBrainState_2017; @finnetal_IdiosynchronySharedResponses_2020; @finnbandettini_MoviewatchingOutperformsRest_2020],
reflect dysfunction in behaviour and cognition [@kebetsetal_FrontolimbicNeuralVariability_2021], and reorganize with brain damage or disease [@baldassarreetal_BrainConnectivityNeurological_2016; @bassettbullmore_HumanBrainNetworks_2009; @carteretal_RestingInterhemisphericFunctional_2010; @laumannetal_BrainNetworkReorganisation_2021]. Nor is it surprising to see this knowledge applied in areas as diverse as personalized psychiatric treatment [@grattonetal_DefiningIndividualSpecificFunctional_2020; @scangosetal_ClosedloopNeuromodulationIndividual_2021], surgical planning [@ottenetal_MotorDeficitsCorrelate_2012; @tieetal_DefiningLanguageNetworks_2014; @wurnigetal_VariabilityClinicalFunctional_2013; @zhangetal_PreoperativeSensorimotorMapping_2009]; biometric security [@chanetal_ChallengesFuturePerspectives_2018], neurofeedback and brain-computer interfaces [@alkobyetal_CanWePredict_2018; @niv_ClinicalEfficacyPotential_2013; [@scangosetal_ClosedloopNeuromodulationIndividual_2021], biomarker discovery [@liuetal_AssessingSpatiotemporalVariability_2019; @shenetal_SignalComplexityIndicators_2021; @sorrentinoetal_ClinicalConnectomeFingerprints_2020], and innovation or improvement of research methods [@conroyetal_IntersubjectAlignmentHuman_2013; @dadietal_BenchmarkingFunctionalConnectomebased_2019; @dadietal_FinegrainAtlasesFunctional_2020; @hackeretal_RestingStateNetwork_2013; @sabuncuetal_FunctionbasedIntersubjectAlignment_2010].

An important question underlying each of these investigations---both for its practical and theoretical consequences---is *how much* and *in which ways* do whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals. Much of the current progress in this area comes from the study of spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging, which provide an indirect measure of brain activity though the process of neurovascular coupling [@hillman_CouplingMechanismSignificance_2014]. Recent investigations using functional magnetic resonance imaging have revealed that although whole brain functional networks share common organizing principles between individuals, there is an approximately equal amount of unshared organization [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018]. These individual-specific deviations in whole brain functional network organization are commonly referred to as *network variants* [@seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]. Importantly, network variants appear to be a phenomenon that is mainly present in comparisons between individuals, and individuals can be reliably separated into subgroups based on similar distributions of network variants, suggesting that network variants may be trait-like [@gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]. Conversely, comparisons within individuals have revealed that individual whole brain functional networks are highly stable, with their organization being influenced only moderately by behavioural or cognitive state and mildly by time [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019].

The neural causes of network variants and their stable trait-like features are not yet known; however, current evidence suggests that whole brain functional network and their variants may be maintained by underlying structural networks and individual-specific subnetworks with long-term histories of coactivations between areas [see @gordonetal_HumanFrontoStriatalConnectivity_2021; @greeneetal_IntegrativeNetworkSpecificConnectivity_2020]. Moreover, both network variants and their clusters also appear to be behaviourally and cognitively relevant, as a number of studies have demonstrated they are predictive of individual differences in behaviour and cognition [e.g., @finnetal_FunctionalConnectomeFingerprinting_2015; @finnetal_CanBrainState_2017; @finnetal_IdiosynchronySharedResponses_2020; @finnbandettini_MoviewatchingOutperformsRest_2020]. Jointly, these findings provide convergent evidence that whole brain functional networks are stable and trait-like, with distinct anatomical and functional variations, and relationships to behaviour and cognition.

In order to observe network variants reliably, previous research has used highly sampled functional magnetic resonance imaging data first analyzed within individuals before making comparisons between individuals [@elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015; cf. @elliottetal_WhatTestRetestReliability_2020]. Analyzing data without this first step, for example by averaging activation maps across individuals voxel-wise, will obscure network variants, leaving only what is common between individuals [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @speelmanmcgann_HowMeanMean_2013]. This may cause substantial and relevant portions of variability in whole brain functional networks to be missed [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018], resulting in unreliable inferences about the ways in which whole brain functional networks differ between individuals [@elliottetal_WhatTestRetestReliability_2020]. Similarly, although the common features of whole brain functional networks can typically be detected with 5-10 minutes of functional magnetic resonance imaging data when averaging across individuals, more than 25 minutes of data (collected continuously or across multiple scans) are needed to reliably detect network variants [@andersonetal_ReproducibilitySingleSubjectFunctional_2011; @elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @hackeretal_RestingStateNetwork_2013; @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015]. Due to the high cost of scan times, this level of measurement is not feasible for a majority of labs collecting their own data [@elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019]. In sum, network variants offer a promising new direction for deepening our understanding of whole brain functional networks, but the conditions required to study them reliably using functional magnetic resonance imaging are a considerable practical barrier. 

A natural solution to this barrier is to explore the feasibility of lower cost neuroimaging modalities for studying network variants beyond the window of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Electrophysiological recording methods such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer one such solution, given their cost effectiveness relative to functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition to cost effectiveness, EEG directly measures the electrophysiological activity of neural populations in the cerebral cortex in real time [@cohen_AnalyzingNeuralTime_2014; @luck_IntroductionEventrelatedPotential_2014; @oneilletal_DynamicsLargescaleElectrophysiological_2018]. This offers two distinct advantages over functional magnetic resonance imaging. First, it allows us to directly probe the synchronization of neural oscillations in functional networks, bypassing the interpretational complexities of linking BOLD signals to the dynamics of underlying neural activity. Second, it allows us to measure neural oscillations at timescales much faster than the infraslow 0.1 Hz oscillations of BOLD signals, making it possible to test whether the organization of network variants is sensitive to timescales [@mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021; @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020].

These advantages could make EEG an invaluable measure for studying network variants, however, there are also two disadvantages to note that may pose a challenge for identifying network variants with EEG. First, the effects of field spread and volume conduction in the head can cause multiple electrodes to record activity from the same underlying neural source [@nunezsrinivasan_ElectricFieldsBrain_2006; @schoffelengross_SourceConnectivityAnalysis_2009], resulting in spurious estimates of connectivity between regions in functional networks. This can be addressed either through source reconstruction methods, which attempt to unmix measured signals to estimate the location of the underlying neural sources; or by using connectivity metrics that account for the effects of field spread and volume conduction in the head, which reduce the possibility of spurious coupling between channels from influencing functional connectivity estimates [@bastosschoffelen_TutorialReviewFunctional_2016]. Second, EEG is generally limited to measuring cortical neural activity and has poor spatial resolution compared to functional magnetic resonance imaging. This means EEG is not well suited for addressing research questions about deep brain network variants; however, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies often limit their focus to cortical network variants [e.g., @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018], so we do not perceive this as a problem. Additionally, although EEG does not have precise spatial resolution in comparison to functional magnetic resonance imaging, numerous studies have demonstrated that measures of electrophysiological connectivity show spatial similarity to the functional connectivity commonly observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging regardless of temporal scale [see @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020]. Given this, similar network variants to those identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging should be identifiable with EEG. However, the vast majority of work using EEG to study whole brain functional networks focuses on group-level approaches, so the feasibility of using EEG to study network variants is largely unknown. 

In light of this, the purpose of the current study is to address the feasibility of using EEG to study network variants. Drawing inspiration from developments in the functional magnetic resonance imaging literature [in particular, see @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018], we will examine how whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals using EEG functional connectivity analysis and measures of network similarity. Figure \@ref(fig:similarity-archetype-plots) depicts six archetypal outcomes we could find. The first row shows outcomes that would occur in cases where functional connectomes *do not* differ between individuals. In particular, we might expect to see (1) high similarity among all measurements regardless of individual, session, or state, which might occur if the brain activity we measured is largely intrinsic and common across individuals [cf. @raichle_TwoViewsBrain_2010]; (2) high similarity among all measurements regardless of individual or state, but not session, which might occur if the brain activity we measured is largely intrinsic, common across individuals, and varies over time in the same way across individuals; or (3) high similarity among all measurements regardless of individual or session, but not state, which might occur if the brain activity we measured is largely reactive in a way that is common across individuals [cf. @raichle_TwoViewsBrain_2010]. The second row shows outcomes that would occur in cases where functional connectomes *do* differ between individuals. In particular, we might expect to see (4) high similarity among all measurements regardless of session or state, but not individual, which might occur if the brain activity we measured is largely intrinsic and unique within individuals; (5) high similarity among all measurements regardless of state, but not individual or session, which might occur if the brain activity we measured is largely intrinsic, unique within individuals, and varies over time within individuals; or (6) high similarity among all measurements regardless of session, but not individual or state, which might occur if the brain activity we measured is largely reactive in a way that is unique within individuals.

It is likely that the real data will be representative of more than one of these archetypes. Based on the prior work discussed above, we expect to find effects consistent with functional connectomes that are more similar within than between individuals, with smaller variations in similarity related to session or state---consistent with the idea that functional networks are stable and trait-like with equal amounts of common and unique variance between individuals. To examine our hypotheses we contrast the magnitude of each of these effects and examine how they are distributed across different timescales using EEG functional connectivity analysis and measures of network similarity.

[^1]: The power and relevance of individual-level approaches in human neuroscience research has been recognized since the start of human neuroimaging using electroencephalography [e.g., @adrianmathews_BergerRhythmPotential_1934; @berger_UberElektrenkephalogrammMenschen_1929; @henry_ElectroencephalographicIndividualDifferences_1941], positron emission tomography [e.g., @schlaugetal_IntersubjectVariabilityCerebral_1994], and functional magnetic resonance imaging [e.g., @rolandzilles_StructuralDivisionsFunctional_1998]. Despite this, human neuroscience research has historically dedicated itself to group-level approaches due to methodological limitations [e.g., @brettetal_ProblemFunctionalLocalization_2002], faulty assumptions about universality and generalizability [e.g., @caramazza_DrawingInferencesStructure_1986; @henson_WhatCanFunctional_2005; cf. @viola_PlatonicBrainFacing_2020], oversimplified conceptions of the role human neuroscience has in the study of behaviour and cognition [for discussions, see @pessoa_UnderstandingBrainNetworks_2014; @ruz_LetBrainExplain_2006; @mcfarland_HowNeuroscienceCan_2017], and sociological factors related to the origins of human neuroscience research [e.g., @posnerdigirolamo_CognitiveNeuroscienceOrigins_2000; @posneretal_CognitiveNeuroscienceDevelopmentsScience_1982].
