# Introduction

A central goal of modern neuroscience is to identify the neural causes of variation in human behaviour and cognition by characterizing how whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals under a variety of conditions [@duboisadolphs_BuildingScienceIndividual_2016; @spornsetal_HumanConnectomeStructural_2005; @vanessenetal_HumanConnectomeProject_2012; see also, @saucematzel_CausesVariationLearning_2013]. Such an approach is providing complimentary information to the group-level approaches conventionally used in human neuroscience research because of its increased sensitivity and resolution [for a brief overview, see @fedorenko_EarlyOriginsGrowing_2021]; reliability and interpretability [@elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018]; and general utility for answering long-standing questions about behaviour and cognition in neuroscience [e.g., @viola_PlatonicBrainFacing_2020], psychology [e.g., @mcfarland_HowNeuroscienceCan_2017], and medicine [e.g., @grattonetal_DefiningIndividualSpecificFunctional_2020].[^1] Large and small scale efforts are now being made to characterize how whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals [for examples of large scale efforts, see @alexanderetal_OpenResourceTransdiagnostic_2017; @vanessenetal_HumanConnectomeProject_2012; for examples of small scale efforts, see @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @poldracketal_LongtermNeuralPhysiological_2015], and it is anticipated that the results of these efforts will lead to more robust, replicable, and meaningful accounts of human behaviour and cognition, and their dysfunction [@elliottetal_WhatTestRetestReliability_2020; @fedorenko_EarlyOriginsGrowing_2021; @mareketal_ReproducibleBrainWideAssociation_2020; cf. @mehlerkording_LureMisleadingCausal_2020; cf. @slomanetal_CognitiveNeuroscienceMeets_2021].

Given the promise of these efforts, it is unsurprising to see individual-level approaches being used to investigate how whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals [@demuruetal_FunctionalEffectiveWhole_2017; @garrettetal_MomenttomomentBrainSignal_2013; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @laumannetal_StabilityBOLDFMRI_2017; @miranda-dominguezetal_ConnectotypingModelBased_2014; @mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021; @vandevilleetal_WhenMakesYou_2021; @zanescoetal_BetweenpersonCorrelatesTemporal_2020], behave across different timescales [@betzeletal_IndividualizedEventStructure_2021; @vandevilleetal_WhenMakesYou_2021], change across the lifespan [@chanetal_DecreasedSegregationBrain_2014; @chanetal_LongtermPrognosisEducational_2021; @dosenbachetal_PredictionIndividualBrain_2010], respond to changing conditions [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021], predict differences in behaviour and cognition [@finnetal_FunctionalConnectomeFingerprinting_2015; @finnetal_CanBrainState_2017; @finnetal_IdiosynchronySharedResponses_2020; @finnbandettini_MoviewatchingOutperformsRest_2020],
reflect dysfunction in behaviour and cognition [@kebetsetal_FrontolimbicNeuralVariability_2021], and reorganize with brain damage or disease [@baldassarreetal_BrainConnectivityNeurological_2016; @bassettbullmore_HumanBrainNetworks_2009; @carteretal_RestingInterhemisphericFunctional_2010; @laumannetal_BrainNetworkReorganisation_2021]. Nor is it surprising to see this knowledge applied in areas as diverse as personalized psychiatric treatment [@grattonetal_DefiningIndividualSpecificFunctional_2020; @scangosetal_ClosedloopNeuromodulationIndividual_2021], surgical planning [@ottenetal_MotorDeficitsCorrelate_2012; @tieetal_DefiningLanguageNetworks_2014; @wurnigetal_VariabilityClinicalFunctional_2013; @zhangetal_PreoperativeSensorimotorMapping_2009]; biometric security [@chanetal_ChallengesFuturePerspectives_2018], neurofeedback and brain-computer interfaces [@alkobyetal_CanWePredict_2018; @niv_ClinicalEfficacyPotential_2013; [@scangosetal_ClosedloopNeuromodulationIndividual_2021], biomarker discovery [@liuetal_AssessingSpatiotemporalVariability_2019; @shenetal_SignalComplexityIndicators_2021; @sorrentinoetal_ClinicalConnectomeFingerprints_2020], and innovation or improvement of research methods [@conroyetal_IntersubjectAlignmentHuman_2013; @dadietal_BenchmarkingFunctionalConnectomebased_2019; @dadietal_FinegrainAtlasesFunctional_2020; @hackeretal_RestingStateNetwork_2013; @sabuncuetal_FunctionbasedIntersubjectAlignment_2010].

An important question underlying each of these investigations---both for its practical and theoretical consequences---is *how much* and *in which ways* do whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals. Recent investigations using functional magnetic resonance imaging have revealed that although whole brain functional networks share common organizing principles between individuals, there is an approximately equal amount of unshared organization [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018]. These individual-specific deviations in whole brain functional network organization are commonly referred to as *network variants* [@seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]. Importantly, network variants appear to be a phenomenon that is mainly present in comparisons between individuals, and individuals can be reliably separated into subgroups based on similar distributions of network variants, suggesting that network variants may be trait-like [@gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]. Conversely, comparisons within individuals have revealed that individual whole brain functional networks are highly stable, with their organization being influenced only moderately by behavioural or cognitive state and mildly by time [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]. The neural causes of network variants and their stable trait-like features are not yet known; however, current evidence suggests that whole brain functional network and their variants may be maintained by underlying structural networks and individual-specific subnetworks with long-term histories of coactivations between areas [see @gordonetal_HumanFrontoStriatalConnectivity_2021; @greeneetal_IntegrativeNetworkSpecificConnectivity_2020]. Moreover, both network variants and their clusters also appear to be behaviourally and cognitively relevant, as a number of studies have demonstrated they are predictive of individual differences in behaviour and cognition [e.g., @finnetal_FunctionalConnectomeFingerprinting_2015; @finnetal_CanBrainState_2017; @finnetal_IdiosynchronySharedResponses_2020; @finnbandettini_MoviewatchingOutperformsRest_2020]. Jointly, these findings provide convergent evidence that whole brain functional networks are stable and trait-like, with distinct anatomical and functional variations, and relationships to behaviour and cognition.

In order to observe network variants reliably, previous research has used highly sampled functional magnetic resonance imaging data first analyzed within individuals before making comparisons between individuals [@elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015; cf. @elliottetal_WhatTestRetestReliability_2020]. Analyzing data without this first step, for example by averaging activation maps across individuals voxel-wise, will obscure network variants, leaving only what is common between individuals [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @speelmanmcgann_HowMeanMean_2013]. This may cause substantial and relevant portions of variability in whole brain functional networks to be missed [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018], resulting in unreliable inferences about the ways in which whole brain functional networks differ between individuals [@elliottetal_WhatTestRetestReliability_2020]. Similarly, although the common features of whole brain functional networks can typically be detected with 5-10 minutes of functional magnetic resonance imaging data when averaging across individuals, more than 25 minutes of data (collected continuously or across multiple scans) are needed to reliably detect network variants [@andersonetal_ReproducibilitySingleSubjectFunctional_2011; @elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @hackeretal_RestingStateNetwork_2013; @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015]. Due to the high cost of scan times, this level of measurement is not feasible for a majority of labs collecting their own data [@elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019]. In sum, network variants offer a promising new direction for deepening our understanding of whole brain functional networks, but the conditions required to study them reliably using functional magnetic resonance imaging are a considerable practical barrier.

I feel like I should maybe talk about what EEG is more here, like in the intro of miljevicetal_EEGconnectivityFundamentalGuide_2021 

It would be good to contrast with BOLD signal too

A natural solution to this barrier is to explore the feasibility of lower cost neuroimaging modalities for investigating network variants beyond the window of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Electrophysiological recording methods such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer one such solution, given their cost effectiveness relative to functional magnetic resonance imaging, and their ability to directly measure whole brain functional networks in real time (at the cost of limited spatial resolution) [see @oneilletal_DynamicsLargescaleElectrophysiological_2018]. The temporal resolution of EEG is particularly relevant, as the temporal aspects of network variants are a growing area of interest in the functional magnetic resonance imaging literature [e.g., @vandevilleetal_WhenMakesYou_2021]. Although EEG does not have precise spatial resolution in comparison to functional magnetic resonance imaging, numerous studies have demonstrated that measures of electrophysiological connectivity show spatial similarity to the functional connectivity commonly observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging regardless of temporal scale [see @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020]. Given this, similar network variants to those identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging should be identifiable with EEG. However, the vast majority of work using EEG to study whole brain functional networks focuses on group-level approaches, so the feasibility of using EEG to study network variants is largely unknown. 

In light of this, the purpose of the current study is to address the feasibility of using EEG to study network variants. Paralleling the respective developments in the functional magnetic resonance imaging literature [in particular, see @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018], <!--  we first test how much data is needed to observe stable effects within an individual using repeated measures resting state EEG. Given the higher temporal resolution of EEG, we expect that shorter data acquisition times will be needed to obtain reliable results. After establishing the amount of data needed to observe stable effects within an individual,  --> we will examine how whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals using EEG source space functional connectivity analysis and measures of network similarity.

There are four archetypal outcomes we could find. The first two outcomes assume brain activity is largely intrinsic, and the last two outcomes assume brain activity is largely reactive [see @raichle_TwoViewsBrain_2010]. First, if functional networks do not differ between or within individuals, then there would be high similarity among all measurements regardless of individual, session, or state. Second, if functional networks do differ between individuals but do not differ within individuals, then there would be high similarity among all measurements within an individual but low similarity between individuals regardless of session or state. Third, if functional networks do not differ between individuals but do differ within individuals, then there would be high similarity between individuals and low similarity within individuals across session and state. Fourth, if functional networks differ between and within individuals, then there would be low similarity among all measurements regardless of individual, session, or state. It is likely that the real data will be representative of more than one of these archetypes. 

Based on the prior work discussed above, we expect to find the strongest effects from the first two archetypes and weaker effects from the third archetype, consistent with the idea that functional networks are stable and trait-like with equal amounts of common and unique variance between individuals. We do not expect to find effects of the fourth archetype, given that this would reflect brain activity that is completely random, which is unlikely. To examine our hypotheses we contrast the magnitude of each of these effects and examine how they are distributed across the brain in each of the canonical frequency bands using EEG source space functional connectivity analysis.

Despite this, human neuroscience research has historically dedicated itself to group-level approaches due to methodological limitations [e.g., @brettetal_ProblemFunctionalLocalization_2002], faulty assumptions about universality and generalizability [e.g., @caramazza_DrawingInferencesStructure_1986; @henson_WhatCanFunctional_2005; cf. @viola_PlatonicBrainFacing_2020], oversimplified conceptions of the role human neuroscience has in the study of behaviour and cognition [for discussions, see @pessoa_UnderstandingBrainNetworks_2014; @ruz_LetBrainExplain_2006; @mcfarland_HowNeuroscienceCan_2017], and sociological factors related to the origins of human neuroscience research [e.g., @posnerdigirolamo_CognitiveNeuroscienceOrigins_2000; @posneretal_CognitiveNeuroscienceDevelopmentsScience_1982].
