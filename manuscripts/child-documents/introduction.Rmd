# Introduction

Human brains, behaviour, and cognition exhibit important differences between and within individuals across the lifespan. A central goal of modern neuroscience is to identify the neural *causes of variation* [@saucematzel_CausesVariationLearning_2013] in human behaviour, cognition, and their dysfunction by characterizing how brain function differs between and within individuals under a variety of conditions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) [for fMRI, see @duboisadolphs_BuildingScienceIndividual_2016; for EEG/MEG, see @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020]. Each of these neuroimaging modalities measure different aspects of brain function across different spatial and temporal scales (and thus have their own strengths and limitations), however, a common point of interest between them is their application to the study of individual differences in whole brain functional network organization [@duboisadolphs_BuildingScienceIndividual_2016; @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020].

Whole brain functional networks are graphs whose *nodes* are either spatially separate brain regions (for fMRI or source-reconstructed EEG/MEG) or sensors (for EEG/MEG) distributed across the entire cerebral cortex,[^1] and whose *edges* quantify the observed statistical dependency between two oscillatory neural signals originating from different nodes in the network. In common neuroscientific parlance, edges in the network represent *functional connectivity* or *coupling* between nodes, subgraphs in the network represent distinct *functional networks*, and the entire graph of the network represents a *functional connectome* [@barchetal_FunctionHumanConnectome_2013; @vanessenetal_HumanConnectomeProject_2012; cf. @spornsetal_HumanConnectomeStructural_2005]. Functional connectomes can be constructed by estimating phase coupling, amplitude coupling, or temporal correlations between all pairs of nodes after band-pass filtering the signals to frequency bands of interest [@bastosschoffelen_TutorialReviewFunctional_2016], and are typically represented by an adjacency matrix of the weighted edges. For fMRI studies, functional connectivity is typically estimated using temporal correlations between signals in a single infraslow frequency band (e.g., 0.009-0.08 Hz), resulting in a single functional connectome; whereas for EEG/MEG studies, functional connectivity is typically estimated using phase coupling and/or amplitude coupling in multiple frequency bands over a wide frequency range (e.g., 1-50 Hz) due to neurophysiological signals containing a mixture of distinct neuronal oscillation frequencies, resulting in multiple concurrent functional connectomes [@sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020].

Over the last two decades, convergent findings from group-averaged fMRI studies have identified that the human functional connectome is governed by an intrinsic functional architecture [@foxetal_HumanBrainIntrinsically_2005; @petersensporns_BrainNetworksCognitive_2015; @raichle_RestlessBrainHow_2015] wherein functional networks exhibit spontaneous coupling between their nodes that can be captured in both the absence and presence of cognitive demands [@poweretal_FunctionalNetworkOrganization_2011; @uddinetal_UniversalTaxonomyMacroscale_2019; @yeoetal_OrganizationHumanCerebral_2011]. A standardized taxonomy of these *intrinsic connectivity networks* [@seeleyetal_DissociableIntrinsicConnectivity_2007] has not yet been adopted [@uddinetal_UniversalTaxonomyMacroscale_2019; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023]; however, the most prominent networks in the literature are commonly delineated and named according to their putative functions.[^99] For example, the most common description delineates these networks into those associated with higher-level functions (default mode, central executive, and salience networks) and those associated with sensorimotor processing (auditory, visual, and sensorimotor networks). Some of these networks are most easily detected in the absence of cognitive demands (i.e., in a *resting state*); others are most easily detected in the presence of cognitive demands (i.e., in a *task state*); and some, such as the default mode network [@biswaletal_FunctionalConnectivityMotor_1995; @greiciusetal_FunctionalConnectivityResting_2003; @raichleetal_DefaultModeBrain_2001; @raichlesnyder_DefaultModeBrain_2007], can be easily detected in both resting and task states [@greiciusmenon_DefaultModeActivityPassive_2004; @honeyetal_PredictingHumanRestingstate_2009]. Additionally, the spatial organization of these networks has been found to be very stable, exhibiting only minor changes under varying cognitive demands [@coleetal_IntrinsicTaskEvokedNetwork_2014; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @krienenetal_ReconfigurableTaskdependentFunctional_2014], and largely persisting in unconscious states such as sleep [@picchionietal_SleepFunctionalConnectome_2013]. More recent studies using group-averaged and source-reconstructed EEG/MEG or simultaneous fMRI-EEG have also corroborated these findings, implicating that (1) a similar organization of the human functional connectome is present across the full range of oscillatory frequencies that are typically measured with EEG/MEG [@engeletal_IntrinsicCouplingModes_2013; @mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021; @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020; @wirsichetal_RelationshipEEGFMRI_2021]; and (2) hemodynamic and electrophysiological functional connectomes are likely different expressions of the same underlying brain activity [@danielarzate-menaetal_StationaryEEGPattern_2022; @mantinietal_ElectrophysiologicalSignaturesResting_2007; @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020].

However, following the discovery of a stable intrinsic organization of the group-averaged human functional connectome, a growing number of studies using fMRI [@bijsterboschetal_RelationshipSpatialConfiguration_2018; @finnetal_FunctionalConnectomeFingerprinting_2015; @gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @gordonetal_IndividualspecificFeaturesBrain_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @kongetal_SpatialTopographyIndividualSpecific_2019; @krausetal_NetworkVariantsAre_2021; @miranda-dominguezetal_ConnectotypingModelBased_2014; @muelleretal_IndividualVariabilityFunctional_2013; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019; @smithetal_BrainHubsDefined_2023]---and to a lesser extent---EEG [@nentwichetal_FunctionalConnectivityEEG_2020] and MEG [@colcloughetal_HowReliableAre_2016] have identified reliable and substantial variability in functional connectome organization across *every* individual studied so far that is either underestimated or missed entirely by group-averaged models of the human functional connectome [@fedorenko_EarlyOriginsGrowing_2021; @fedorenkoblank_BrocaAreaNot_2020; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @muelleretal_IndividualVariabilityFunctional_2013; @speelmanmcgann_HowMeanMean_2013; @zillesamunts_IndividualVariabilityNot_2013]. This has been demonstrated using a variety of approaches. For example, using community detection algorithms, @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015 found evidence of an idiosyncratic spatial organization between individual and group-averaged functional connectomes such that certain functional networks present in the individual were not present in the group (and vice versa); comparing spatial correlations between individual and group-averaged functional connectomes, @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019 found similar evidence of an idiosyncratic spatial organization across individuals, wherein certain spatially contiguous cortical regions were weakly correlated between individual and group-averaged functional connectomes (the location, size, and functional network assignments of these regions differed across individuals); and comparing functional connectome similarity between and within individuals, @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018 found that functional connectomes were consistently more similar within than between individuals regardless of varying cognitive demands or time. Borrowing from @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019, here we use the term *network variants* as a catch-all shorthand to refer to individual differences in functional connectome organization relative to either a group-averaged functional connectome or other individuals' functional connectomes. These individual differences may present themselves in several forms, including interindividual variability in connectivity strength, the size and position of network nodes, or network topography [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023].

The purpose of this thesis is to explore the feasibility of studying network variants with EEG, addressing the growing need to incorporate findings derived from neurophysiological imaging modalities to enrich our understanding of individual differences in whole brain functional network organization beyond what can be learned from fMRI alone [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023]. Whereas the first studies of the group-averaged human functional connectome using fMRI date back to the mid-2000s [e.g., @beckmannetal_InvestigationsRestingstateConnectivity_2005], studies using EEG/MEG did not begin until the early 2010s [e.g., @brookesetal_MeasuringFunctionalConnectivity_2011], and the investigation and characterization of whole brain functional networks continues to be heavily biased towards fMRI research methods [@uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023]. Likewise, although the first studies of network variants using fMRI date back to the early 2010s [e.g., @muelleretal_IndividualVariabilityFunctional_2013], we are only aware of one recently published study using EEG [@nentwichetal_FunctionalConnectivityEEG_2020] and another using MEG [@colcloughetal_HowReliableAre_2016]; thus, current knowledge about network variants is almost exclusively based on infraslow frequency functional connectomes measured with fMRI, and it is an open question whether or not higher frequency functional connectomes measured with neuroimaging modalities such as EEG share similar evidence of stable individual differences [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020]. Here we take one modest step towards addressing this question.

The remainder of the introduction is organized as follows: First, we review the intrinsic functional organization of the human brain, focusing on the features of computation and communication in neuronal networks that functional connectivity analysis seeks to (at least partly) quantify. Second, we review oscillatory neural signals measured by fMRI and EEG and their connection to underlying neuronal activity, as well as some of the challenges fMRI and EEG face in the pursuit of studying network variants. Third, we provide an overview of functional connectivity analysis, with a focus on methodology in order to build intuition around the interpretation of phase coupling and amplitude coupling. Fourth, we provide background on the motivations for network variant research, followed by a review of key findings. Finally, we introduce the study conducted for this thesis.

## Intrinsic functional organization of the human brain

The adult human brain consists of approximately 86 billion neurons that are organized into a topologically complex network of spatially separate and functionally specialized neuronal populations connected by short and long range axonal projections upon which neurotransmission unfolds [@azevedoetal_EqualNumbersNeuronal_2009; @cadwelletal_DevelopmentArealizationCerebral_2019; @cohen_AnalyzingNeuralTime_2014; @cohen_WhereDoesEEG_2017; @bullmoresporns_ComplexBrainNetworks_2009; @hagmannetal_MappingStructuralCore_2008; @spornsetal_HumanConnectomeStructural_2005; @yuste_NeuronDoctrineNeural_2015]. Neuronal connectivity throughout this complex network is bidirectional and highly branched, allowing for both the simultaneous broadcast of local computations to global areas and of global computations to local areas [@buzsakiwatson_BrainRhythmsNeural_2012]; in turn, local and distant neuronal populations are able to dynamically couple to one another through transient synchronized rhythmic interactions between presynaptic senders and postsynaptic receivers, forming functional networks that are believed to support the vast repertoire of human behaviour, cognition, and normal brain function [@buzsakiwatson_BrainRhythmsNeural_2012; @buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @fries_RhythmsCognitionCommunication_2015; @friston_FunctionalIntegrationInference_2002; @friston_FunctionalEffectiveConnectivity_2011]. Here, at the level of individuals, complex interactions between divergent initial conditions (i.e., genetic, environmental, and psychological differences) and experiences (i.e., episodes of behaviour and cognition in tandem with developmental histories) lay down the traces for highly individualistic developmental trajectories as the real-time processes of the brain unfold---sculpting individual patterns of network organization that progressively consolidate and self-reinforce their own emergent structures through synaptic proliferation, strengthening, and pruning over the course of the lifespan [@bateson_RobustnessPlasticityDevelopment_2017; @brown_IndividualDifferencesHuman_2017; @cadwelletal_DevelopmentArealizationCerebral_2019; @gukanai_WhatContributesIndividual_2014; @lewis_SelforganizingIndividualDifferences_2005; @stilesjernigan_BasicsBrainDevelopment_2010]. Thus, the complexity of this network is also reflected in its dynamic features, such as its intrinsic activity, high energy costs, system of oscillatory rhythms, and moment-to-moment variability, as well as its inherent variability between and within individuals across the lifespan. [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @garrettetal_MomenttomomentBrainSignal_2013; @lewis_SelforganizingIndividualDifferences_2005; @raichle_TwoViewsBrain_2010; @raichle_RestlessBrainHow_2015].

Neuronal activity is primarily intrinsic---occurring in an ongoing manner not directly associated with external stimuli or cognitive demands---and can be characterized by its high energy costs, oscillatory patterning, and moment-to-moment variability  [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @garrettetal_MomenttomomentBrainSignal_2013; @raichle_TwoViewsBrain_2010; @raichle_RestlessBrainHow_2015]. Intrinsic activity accounts for the majority of the brain's energy costs [@raichle_TwoViewsBrain_2010; @raichle_RestlessBrainHow_2015]. In the absence of behavioural and cognitive demands, brain energy consumption accounts for around 20% of all energy consumed by the body of the average adult human; however, this high rate of ongoing energy consumption is affected very little by behavioural and cognitive demands, with even the most arousing perceptual tasks and vigorous motor tasks causing at most a 5% difference in additional energy consumption compared to the resting state baseline [@raichle_TwoViewsBrain_2010; @raichle_RestlessBrainHow_2015]. The majority of this energy budget is devoted to neuronal signalling processes, such as postsynaptic glutamate receptors, action potentials, resting potentials, presynaptic neurotransmitter release, and neurotransmitter recycling [@howarthetal_UpdatedEnergyBudgets_2012; @raichle_TwoViewsBrain_2010; @raichle_RestlessBrainHow_2015; @raichlemintun_BrainWorkBrain_2006], and therefore, to computation and communication in neuronal networks.

Oscillatory patterning, which reflects the timing of neuronal activity, is a basic property of normal brain function [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @buzsakiwatson_BrainRhythmsNeural_2012; @cohen_WhereDoesEEG_2017; @fries_RhythmsCognitionCommunication_2015]. Neuronal networks have a natural tendency to engage in oscillatory activity because the intrinsic properties of both individual neurons and canonical circuit motifs favour rhythmic activity instead of continuous activity [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @buzsakidraguhn_NeuronalOscillationsCortical_2004; @buzsakietal_OriginExtracellularFields_2012; @singer_NeuronalOscillationsUnavoidable_2018; @turkheimeretal_BrainCodeIts_2015; @whittingtonetal_FutureNeuronalOscillation_2018]. In individual neurons, the refractory period following an action potential naturally imposes cyclic fluctuations of excitability wherein oscillatory patterning can appear as either fluctuations of the membrane potential or as rhythmic patterns of action potentials, which can then entrain postsynaptic neurons to oscillate in synchrony with the inducing pulses if the pulse frequency is close to their preferred membrane resonance frequency [@singer_NeuronalOscillationsUnavoidable_2018]. At the level of local neuronal populations, canonical circuit motifs such as negative feedback loops can give rise to large-scale oscillations as excitatory neurons drive inhibitory neurons that subsequently inhibit the very same excitatory neurons, naturally leading to an oscillatory patterning of responses between the presynaptic and postsynaptic networks [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @buzsakiwang_MechanismsGammaOscillations_2012; @fries_RhythmsCognitionCommunication_2015; @singer_NeuronalOscillationsUnavoidable_2018].

Here the frequency, regularity, and probability of oscillatory coupling depends on the time constants of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, which provide windows of alternating reduced and enhanced excitability for action potentials to occur [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @buzsakiwatson_BrainRhythmsNeural_2012; @fries_RhythmsCognitionCommunication_2015; @singer_NeuronalOscillationsUnavoidable_2018]. If the time constants are similar between the presynaptic and postsynaptic networks, incoming excitatory postsynaptic potentials will arrive at the peak of enhanced excitability and have a high probability to summate effectively and generate action potentials; however, if the time constants are too dissimilar, excitatory postsynaptic potentials will arrive during inhibitory windows and have a lower probability to summate effectively and reach the firing threshold because of hyperpolarization [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @buzsakiwatson_BrainRhythmsNeural_2012; @fries_RhythmsCognitionCommunication_2015; @singer_NeuronalOscillationsUnavoidable_2018]. Thus, oscillations provide a putative mechanism through which the brain can dynamically coordinate the flow of information by effectively gating or biasing whether computations are amplified or ignored by different senders and receivers throughout the network [@bastosschoffelen_TutorialReviewFunctional_2016; @buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @buzsakidraguhn_NeuronalOscillationsCortical_2004; @buzsakiwatson_BrainRhythmsNeural_2012; @engeletal_IntrinsicCouplingModes_2013; @garrettetal_MomenttomomentBrainSignal_2013; @schnitzlergross_NormalPathologicalOscillatory_2005].

Neuronal networks in the cerebral cortex support several families of oscillations (oscillatory bands) that act relatively independently, are continuously present, and span from approximately 0.05 Hz to 500 Hz, covering more than four orders of magnitude on a temporal scale [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @buzsakidraguhn_NeuronalOscillationsCortical_2004; @buzsakiwatson_BrainRhythmsNeural_2012]. These oscillatory bands are defined as frequency bands with logarithmically increasing centre frequencies and relatively constant frequency width ratios between neighbouring bands (Figure \@ref(fig:oscillatory-bands-plot)). Each band is characterized by a distinct temporal processing window determined by its frequency, and several rhythms can temporally coexist, compete, or otherwise interact with each other locally or globally [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @buzsakidraguhn_NeuronalOscillationsCortical_2004]. The number of neurons that can participate in a given rhythm is constrained by the slow axon conduction velocity of neurons; thus, relative to higher frequency oscillations, lower frequency oscillations involve more neurons and are associated with larger membrane potential fluctuations because in longer temporal windows the action potentials of many more presynaptic neurons can be integrated [@buzsakiwatson_BrainRhythmsNeural_2012]. Because of this structural constraint, when multiple oscillations are present simultaneously, the phase of slower oscillations modulates the amplitude of faster oscillations [@buzsakiwatson_BrainRhythmsNeural_2012].

For each band, the approximate bandwidth and centre frequency is shown along with its commonly used name."

```

Along with their system of rhythms, neuronal networks in the cerebral cortex are characterized by their high moment-to-moment variability---wherein ever-changing conditions driven largely by intrinsic activity provoke unceasing transitions between qualitatively different states of coupling within and between neuronal populations throughout the network [@danielarzate-menaetal_StationaryEEGPattern_2022; @faisaletal_NoiseNervousSystem_2008; @garrettetal_MomenttomomentBrainSignal_2013; @hutchisonetal_DynamicFunctionalConnectivity_2013; @michelkoenig_EEGMicrostatesTool_2018; @steinetal_NeuronalVariabilityNoise_2005]. These state-to-state transitions are governed by itinerant dynamics [@kanekotsuda_ChaoticItinerancy_2003], whereby the network explores multiple discrete states of coupling which may be continually revisited over time rather than settling into any particular state, providing a necessary level of moment-to-moment flexibility to respond to a greater range of imperfect, changing, and otherwise variable stimuli in a way that precludes overfitting whilst maintaining some level of stability and persistence [@breakspear_DynamicModelsLargescale_2017; @decocorbetta_DynamicalBalanceBrain_2011; @garrettetal_MomenttomomentBrainSignal_2013; @hutchisonetal_DynamicFunctionalConnectivity_2013; @sporns_ComplexBrainConnectivity_2022]. In other words, this balance of moment-to-moment variability with recurrence acts as a kind of dynamical scaffold around which the network can organize, capable of creating a large and variable repertoire of stable intrinsic network states when integrated over longer time periods [@danielarzate-menaetal_StationaryEEGPattern_2022; @decocorbetta_DynamicalBalanceBrain_2011; @garrettetal_MomenttomomentBrainSignal_2013; @hutchisonetal_DynamicFunctionalConnectivity_2013; @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020; @sporns_ComplexBrainConnectivity_2022]. Because of this behaviour, the coupling dynamics of neuronal networks can often be sufficiently modelled using methods that (1) do not take the temporal order of time points into account, and (2) assume that the time series is stationary [@danielarzate-menaetal_StationaryEEGPattern_2022; @matkovicetal_StaticDynamicFMRIderived_2023].

The purpose of functional connectivity analysis is to (at least partly) quantify these neurotransmission-mediated interactions, in order to better understand the nature of computation and communication in large-scale brain networks [@bastosschoffelen_TutorialReviewFunctional_2016; @mostamesadaghiani_PhaseAmplitudecouplingAre_2020]. To this end, several neuroimaging and analysis methods have been developed to study group-averaged and individual whole brain functional networks. In the following sections we will focus on fMRI and EEG, and how the analysis of their oscillatory signals has contributed to our understanding of the human functional connectome.

## Measuring human brain oscillations

Ongoing oscillations---reflecting synchronized rhythmic fluctuations in the excitability of local neuronal populations---are the most prominent feature of all neural signals and can be described by three pieces of information: frequency, amplitude, and phase [@cohen_AnalyzingNeuralTime_2014; @cohen_WhereDoesEEG_2017; @luck_IntroductionEventrelatedPotential_2014]. Frequency is the number of oscillatory cycles per second and is measured in hertz (Hz); it describes the speed or timescale of an oscillation. Amplitude is the peak to trough distance of an oscillation and is typically measured in microvolts (mV) for EEG and percent change from baseline for fMRI, normalized from the arbitrary units (AU) of the raw BOLD signal by some baseline value (e.g., the signal mean\; @liuetal_GlobalSignalFMRI_2017); it generally has an inverse relationship with frequency such that higher frequency oscillations have lower amplitudes, and vice versa. Phase is the timing of an oscillation relative to where it is along its oscillatory cycle and is measured in radians or degrees; it is independent of amplitude, so the neural dynamics reflected in amplitude are distinct from those reflected in phase [@cohen_AnalyzingNeuralTime_2014]. These properties of an oscillation are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:oscillation-plot), which depicts two sinusoidal waves with the same amplitude (1 AU) and phase (0 degrees) but different frequencies (1 Hz and 2 Hz) evolving over the course of one second in both Cartesian and polar coordinates.

Neuronal interactions occur within one or many oscillatory frequency bands due to neuronal populations throughout the cerebral cortex being capable of generating multiple oscillation frequencies both concurrently and selectively, and responding selectively to inputs at multiple preferred frequencies due to the membrane resonances of individual neurons [@akamkullmann_OscillationsFilteringNetworks_2010; @blankenburgetal_InformationFilteringResonant_2015; @hutcheonyarom_ResonanceOscillationIntrinsic_2000; @kopelletal_AreDifferentRhythms_2010; @whittingtonetal_FutureNeuronalOscillation_2018]. From a biophysics perspective, much is known about the origins of fMRI and EEG signals and their connection to underlying neuronal activity [@buxton_PhysicsFunctionalMagnetic_2013; @buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @cohen_WhereDoesEEG_2017; @nunezsrinivasan_ElectricFieldsBrain_2006]. Here we briefly review these origins, as well as some of the challenges fMRI and EEG face in the pursuit of studying network variants.

### fMRI

fMRI measures low frequency (< 0.1 Hz) oscillations in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals caused primarily by decreases in local concentrations of paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin in response to increases in local excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic neuronal activity through the active process of neurovascular coupling [@halletal_RelationshipMEGFMRI_2014; @hillman_CouplingMechanismSignificance_2014; @moonetal_ContributionExcitatoryInhibitory_2021]. When local neuronal activity increases, oxygen extraction from the blood increases, resulting in increased amounts of deoxyhemoglobin in the blood; however, within approximately 500 milliseconds and peaking around 3-5 seconds before slowly returning to baseline, neurovascular signals increase blood flow and volume to the responding region, bringing oxygenated blood in sufficient excess to overoxygenate the region and wash out deoxyhemoglobin [@hillman_CouplingMechanismSignificance_2014]. Due to the magnetic properties of deoxyhemoglobin, this net decrease in local concentrations of deoxyhemoglobin causes changes in the magnetic field [i.e., $T_2^*$ relaxation\; @ogawaetal_BrainMagneticResonance_1990] which are reflected as fluctuations in the magnetic resonance signal [@buxton_PhysicsFunctionalMagnetic_2013]. For typical whole brain fMRI studies, a single image of the brain (i.e., one volume) is obtained by sequentially acquiring images of all of the slices that cover the brain with a repetition time of about 3 seconds (i.e., the duration to obtain one volume); BOLD signals are recorded at voxels distributed throughout the brain volume, typically with a voxel size of about 3 mm$^3$ [@bijsterbosch_IntroductionRestingState_2017; @buxton_PhysicsFunctionalMagnetic_2013]. Thus, fMRI provides a spatially precise---but indirect, slow, and temporally delayed---proxy measure of underlying neuronal activity whose interpretation is intrinsically linked to understanding the physiological and metabolic processes that modulate blood flow in the brain [@drew_NeurovascularCouplingMotive_2022; @halletal_InterpretingBOLDDialogue_2016; @hillman_CouplingMechanismSignificance_2014].

An important implication of this complication in interpreting fMRI data, particularly for studies of network variants, is that any individual differences in BOLD signal functional connectivity may reflect differences in neuronal activity, neurovascular coupling, or both [@bijsterbosch_IntroductionRestingState_2017]. Although it is commonly assumed that fMRI is detecting individual differences in neuronal activity, it cannot be ruled out that any individual differences observed with fMRI are the result of non-neuronal factors known to influence BOLD signal functional connectivity [e.g., the maximum oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, which is known to vary considerably and systematically between individuals\; @hillman_CouplingMechanismSignificance_2014; @wardetal_IndividualDifferencesHaemoglobin_2020; @yangetal_ImpactHematocritMeasurements_2014].

In addition, fMRI is a generally non-portable resource-demanding method, which places a basic restriction on who can collect fMRI data---and consequently---who can participate and benefit from fMRI research. For instance, all of the network variant studies cited in this thesis were conducted by researchers from high-income countries like the United States. Given that the broad purpose of these studies is to investigate variability in functional connectome organization across individuals---with the ultimate goal of identifying the neural causes of variation in human behaviour, cognition, and their dysfunction---our understanding of these individual differences may be distorted or otherwise undermined by the use of samples that differ in many concrete ways from the broader human population living in low-income and middle-income countries, such as their genetic, environmental, social, economic, political, and demographic diversity [@batteletal_MindBrainGap_2021; @campbelltishkoff_AfricanGeneticDiversity_2008; @falketal_WhatRepresentativeBrain_2013; @henrichetal_WeirdestPeopleWorld_2010; @muthukrishnaetal_WesternEducatedIndustrial_2020]; and prevalence of neurological disease [@parraetal_DementiaLatinAmerica_2018] and neurodevelopmental disorders [@bittaetal_BurdenNeurodevelopmentalDisorders_2017].

### EEG

EEG measures oscillations in extracellular currents caused primarily by summed excitatory and inhibitory dendritic postsynaptic potentials from thousands of cortical pyramidal cells in parallel alignment, whose dipoles are oriented perpendicularly to the cortical surface [@cohen_AnalyzingNeuralTime_2014]. Large-scale synchronous events of this nature create electrical fields powerful enough to conduct instantaneously through the brain, meninges, skull, and scalp, to scalp electrodes that measure fluctuations in these fields in real time [@cohen_AnalyzingNeuralTime_2014; @cohen_WhereDoesEEG_2017; @luck_IntroductionEventrelatedPotential_2014]. Other sources of oscillations such as individual neurons, smaller populations of neurons, large populations of neurons with opposing dipoles oriented tangentially to the cortical surface, or deep brain sources either produce no electrical fields or weak electrical fields that cannot be measured at the scalp [@cohen_AnalyzingNeuralTime_2014]. Furthermore, although oscillations occur across a wide frequency range [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011], very slow oscillations (< 0.1 Hz) can be difficult to measure due to limitations of most EEG systems, as can faster oscillations (> 80 Hz) due to their low amplitude making them hard to distinguish from noise [@cohen_AnalyzingNeuralTime_2014]. For typical EEG studies, electrophysiological oscillations are recorded simultaneously at electrodes distributed evenly across the scalp (usually 64, 128, or 256 electrodes) with sampling rates of $\geq$ 500 Hz, then further processed into single or multiple frequency bands that are thought to capture distinct oscillations within this range [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011]. Thus, EEG provides a direct (albeit incomplete) measure of neuronal activity with a high temporal resolution, whose interpretation bypasses the complications of linking BOLD signals to the dynamics of underlying neuronal activity. However, because EEG signals are measured using electrodes on the scalp rather than voxels in the brain, the spatial interpretation of EEG is intrinsically linked to understanding how the volume conduction properties of the human head mediates the relationship between EEG signals measured at the scalp and their underlying neuronal sources [@laietal_ComparisonScalpSourcereconstructed_2018; @nunezsrinivasan_ElectricFieldsBrain_2006; @schoffelengross_SourceConnectivityAnalysis_2009].

Volume conduction simply refers to the effects of measuring electrical fields at a distance from their source. The primary effect of volume conduction in EEG is field spread---wherein the electrical fields generated by a source can spread not only to the nearest electrode, but also to other electrodes (up to tens of centimetres away) [@cohen_AnalyzingNeuralTime_2014; @nunezsrinivasan_ElectricFieldsBrain_2006; @schaworonkownikulin_SensorSpaceAnalysis_2022; @schoffelengross_SourceConnectivityAnalysis_2009]. This creates two challenges for studying whole brain functional networks with EEG. First, because the locations of electrodes are not trivially related to the locations of their sources, the topography of scalp-level EEG cannot be interpreted in terms of the underlying neuroanatomy [@laietal_ComparisonScalpSourcereconstructed_2018; @mahjooryetal_ConsistencyEEGSource_2017]. For example, occipital alpha sources (8-13 Hz) can account for a very large part of the activity measured by frontal electrodes in simulated and empirical data, with the extent of this effect varying based on the dipole orientation of the source, the amplitude of the oscillations, cortical anatomy, and the choice of the reference electrode [@chellaetal_ImpactReferenceChoice_2016; @cohen_AnalyzingNeuralTime_2014; @haufeetal_CriticalAssessmentConnectivity_2013; @schaworonkownikulin_SensorSpaceAnalysis_2022]. Consequently, functional connectivity between, for example, a frontal and occipital electrode may not reflect functional connectivity a frontal and occipital source. However, by these same physical laws, differences in functional connectivity imply that different distributions of neuronal sources are active in the brain over space and time; thus, although volume conduction precludes a neurophysiological interpretation of the topography of scalp-level EEG, differences in functional connectome organization within and between individuals provide an opaque indication of differences in global network activity [@michelkoenig_EEGMicrostatesTool_2018; @schoffelengross_SourceConnectivityAnalysis_2009]. Second, because the same source can be measured by multiple electrodes simultaneously, there is a potential for estimates of functional connectivity between two electrodes to be confounded by those two electrodes measuring the same source [@cohen_AnalyzingNeuralTime_2014; @laietal_ComparisonScalpSourcereconstructed_2018]. Given that the ultimate purpose of functional connectivity analysis is to identify and quantify interactions between spatially separate neuronal populations, the challenges caused by volume conduction are non-trivial and it is now widely acknowledged that volume conduction should be accounted for in EEG functional connectivity analyses [@bastosschoffelen_TutorialReviewFunctional_2016; @haufeetal_CriticalAssessmentConnectivity_2013; @laietal_ComparisonScalpSourcereconstructed_2018; @nolteetal_IdentifyingTrueBrain_2004; @schoffelengross_SourceConnectivityAnalysis_2009].

To date, two main approaches have been employed throughout the literature to address the challenges caused by volume conduction. The first approach is to use inverse source reconstruction methods, which attempt to unmix the activity measured across all electrodes to estimate the location of the underlying sources [@michelbrunet_EEGSourceImaging_2019]. Source localization is an ill-posed problem (i.e., it has an infinite number of solutions) that works by first modelling the volume conduction properties of the human head to determine the potential at each scalp electrode that would be generated by hypothetical dipoles in the brain (the forward model); then---taking into consideration the forward model and electrode noise---using an inverse source reconstruction algorithm (the source model) to estimate the dipole parameters that best explain the observed scalp potential measurements, based on constraints and assumptions imposed by the source model about the underlying sources [@grechetal_ReviewSolvingInverse_2008; @michelbrunet_EEGSourceImaging_2019]. The spatial fidelity and accuracy of source localization and subsequent functional connectivity estimates is affected by several factors, including the accuracy of the forward model [@akalinacarmakeig_EffectsForwardModel_2013; @cespedes-villaretal_InfluencePatientSpecificHead_2020; @chauveauetal_EffectsSkullThickness_2004; @dalaletal_ConsequencesEEGElectrode_2014; @hallezetal_ReviewSolvingForward_2007; @hongetal_HowReducingModel_2011; @liuetal_ComparisonEEGSource_2023; @liuetal_DetectingLargeScaleBrain_2018; @mccannbeltrachini_ImpactSkullSutures_2022; @nielsenetal_EvaluatingInfluenceAnatomical_2023; @tabernaetal_DetectionRestingStateFunctional_2021], the chosen source model [@hatlestad-halletal_ReliableEvaluationFunctional_2023; @haufeetal_CriticalAssessmentConnectivity_2013; @liuetal_DetectingLargeScaleBrain_2018; @mahjooryetal_ConsistencyEEGSource_2017; @nguyen-danseetal_FeasibilityReconstructingSource_2021; @nolteetal_IdentifyingTrueBrain_2004], instrumental or biological noise [@ryynanenetal_EffectElectrodeDensity_2004; @ryynanenetal_EffectMeasurementNoise_2006; @whittingstalletal_EffectsDipolePosition_2003], and electrode density [@hatlestad-halletal_ReliableEvaluationFunctional_2023; @michelbrunet_EEGSourceImaging_2019; @seecketal_StandardizedEEGElectrode_2017]; because of these factors, the validity of source space functional connectivity estimates may be in question in the absence of other sources of convergent evidence (e.g., fMRI, animal models, etc.). Inverse source reconstruction methods primarily address the first challenge for studying whole brain functional networks with EEG---by estimating the location of the underlying sources, signals are localized to dipoles in the brain, making it possible to interpret EEG in terms of the underlying neuroanatomy. However, artifacts of volume conduction persist in all source estimates (where they are often referred to as source or signal leakage), thus source-reconstructed EEG can still contain spurious estimates of functional connectivity [@bastosschoffelen_TutorialReviewFunctional_2016; @haufeetal_CriticalAssessmentConnectivity_2013; @schoffelengross_SourceConnectivityAnalysis_2009].

<!-- Source-reconstructed EEG is generally a resource-demanding method, requiring the same resources as fMRI in addition to an EEG or simultaneous fMRI-EEG system; however, it is possible to reduce resource demands by using a template MRI of an average human head rather than individual MRI scans for the forward model [@michelbrunet_EEGSourceImaging_2019]. Whether or not it is appropriate to use a template MRI for source-reconstructed EEG network variant studies is an open question. While the advantages of using individual MRI scans for the forward model are obvious---and there is sufficient evidence that using a template MRI results in less precise source localization [@brodbecketal_ElectroencephalographicSourceImaging_2011; @guggisbergetal_LocalizationCorticoperipheralCoherence_2011]---no study to date has investigated how the variability of functional connectome organization changes between and within individuals when using individual or template MRIs. Rather than speculate, here we simply note that in cases where a template MRI is used (or where analyses are done in sensor space rather than source space), EEG is a portable and less resource-demanding method relative to fMRI, with research-grade systems typically costing anywhere from around \$30,000 to \$100,000 depending on the configuration, negligible recording costs, and shorter recording times (due to the high sampling rate), making it a potentially more accessible method to a broader population of researchers and research participants [@ledwidgeetal_RecommendationsDevelopingEEG_2018], including those from lower-income and middle-income countries [@bhavnanietal_AcceptabilityFeasibilityUtility_2022; cf. @nguyen-danseetal_FeasibilityReconstructingSource_2021]. -->

The second approach to addressing the challenges caused by volume conduction is to use functional connectivity metrics that are unlikely to be explained by common sources and are thus robust to volume conduction [@nolteetal_IdentifyingTrueBrain_2004; @stametal_PhaseLagIndex_2007]. A variety of robust functional connectivity metrics have been developed to accomplish this [@bastosschoffelen_TutorialReviewFunctional_2016; @hippetal_LargescaleCorticalCorrelation_2012], all of which operate under the same basic principle: Because volume conduction from a common source to multiple electrodes is instantaneous, electrodes measuring a common source will have their signals phase locked with a time lag of zero; conversely, phase locking with a nonzero time lag cannot be caused by volume conduction from a common source, so signals with a consistent nonzero phase difference are likely to have been generated by separate sources [@nolteetal_IdentifyingTrueBrain_2004; @stametal_PhaseLagIndex_2007]. Functional connectivity between such signals can, therefore, be interpreted in terms of true interactions between the underlying neuronal sources [@nolteetal_IdentifyingTrueBrain_2004; @stametal_PhaseLagIndex_2007]. However, it is important to note that true zero lag interactions also occur in neuronal networks [@golloetal_MechanismsZeroLagSynchronization_2014], and it is likely that this approach misses parts of the brain's interactions, leading to the underestimation of connectivity strength between nodes [@cohen_EffectsTimeLag_2015; @nolteetal_IdentifyingTrueBrain_2004; @stametal_PhaseLagIndex_2007]. Thus, weak or absent functional connectivity with these metrics could either mean there truly is no interaction, or that the interaction between two sources is not consistently delayed such that one of the sources regularly leads or lags the other one [@nolteetal_IdentifyingTrueBrain_2004; @stametal_PhaseLagIndex_2007].

Finally, because EEG measures oscillations across a broad range of frequencies, and because neuronal populations are capable of generating and responding to multiple oscillation frequencies, it is generally necessary to further process EEG signals into single or multiple frequency bands using band-pass filtering in order to investigate oscillations occurring at different timescales [@sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020]. EEG is typically limited to investigating canonical frequency bands (i.e., Delta, 1-4 Hz; Theta, 4-8 Hz; Alpha, 8-13 Hz; Beta, 13-30 Hz; Gamma, 30-80 Hz). Furthermore, because of EEG's susceptibility to 60 Hz electrical line noise, the upper bound of the Gamma band is often reduced to a frequency below 60 Hz where artifacts from line noise are less prominent.

## Revealing the intrinsic functional organization of the human brain

As the previous section established, EEG and fMRI signals reflect synchronized rhythmic fluctuations in the excitability of local neuronal populations, the timing of which is encoded by the phase of the signal and the magnitude of which by the amplitude. These fluctuations vary in frequency, amplitude, and phase over time, reflecting the dynamics of neuronal activity caused by ongoing interactions within and between anatomically connected neuronal populations distributed throughout the cortex. As the dynamics of ongoing activity unfold upon this structural network, spatially distributed neuronal populations dynamically and recurrently couple to one another, forming creating a large and variable repertoire of stable intrinsic network states when integrated over longer time periods [@danielarzate-menaetal_StationaryEEGPattern_2022; @decocorbetta_DynamicalBalanceBrain_2011; @garrettetal_MomenttomomentBrainSignal_2013; @honeyetal_NetworkStructureCerebral_2007; @hutchisonetal_DynamicFunctionalConnectivity_2013; @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020; @sporns_ComplexBrainConnectivity_2022].

Functional connectivity analysis provides a useful framework for describing the coupling that occurs in neuronal networks and is based on the following assumption: If two nodes in a functional connectome have a (strong, consistent) statistical dependency between their signals over time, they are both likely to be involved in the same brain function(s), and thus functionally connected [@bijsterbosch_IntroductionRestingState_2017; @engeletal_IntrinsicCouplingModes_2013]. Because both EEG and fMRI signals are most strongly related to synchronized postsynaptic activity and not to neuronal firing rates, it is important to keep in mind that the coupling described by functional connectivity analysis is based on the inputs to local neuronal populations rather than their outputs [@bijsterbosch_IntroductionRestingState_2017]. Moreover, we limit our discussion here to same-frequency undirected functional connectivity analysis, which is currently the primary means of estimating functional connectivity used throughout the literature as well as this thesis. For discussions of cross-frequency coupling and directed functional connectivity analysis, we direct the reader to reviews by @canoltyknight_FunctionalRoleCrossfrequency_2010 and @bastosschoffelen_TutorialReviewFunctional_2016, respectively.

A common acquisition method for functional connectivity analysis in the context of individual differences research is the resting state paradigm, which involves a passive state wherein participants are simply required to sit or lie still with their eyes either closed or open and fixated on a cross (while blinking normally) for the duration of the recording, without being instructed to think of anything in particular [@grattonetal_DefiningIndividualSpecificFunctional_2020; @smithetal_FunctionalConnectomicsRestingstate_2013]. The primary motivation behind this paradigm is that it is a robust method for measuring the intrinsic activity that accounts for the majority of the brain's energy demands [@raichle_TwoViewsBrain_2010; @raichle_RestlessBrainHow_2015] that is: easy to acquire and standardize across sites and populations, including those that may not be able to perform more demanding cognitive or behavioural tasks during acquisition [@bijsterbosch_IntroductionRestingState_2017; @foxgreicius_ClinicalApplicationsResting_2010]; and less vulnerable to confounds related to more demanding cognitive or behavioural tasks such as performance, motivation, strategy, practice, or repetition effects, making it suitable for longitudinal designs where stability over time is a point of interest [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017; @foxgreicius_ClinicalApplicationsResting_2010]<!--; “These results support the emerging hypothesis that the brain’s repertoire of responses to the external world are represented and updated in the brain’s intrinsic functional architecture.” ([Mennes et al., 2011, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/JQYGUZPR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/C7VGTUWP?page=1&annotation=AF9WQDGG))-->. Although the behavioural and cognitive demands of eyes closed and eyes open resting state are similar, each brain state is qualitatively distinct---with associated changes (on average) in the global power and topography of all oscillatory bands from eyes closed to eyes open resting state, the most prominent of these being a widespread reduction in alpha band oscillations [@barryetal_EEGDifferencesEyesclosed_2007; @barryetal_EEGDifferencesChildren_2009; @barrydeblasio_EEGDifferencesEyesclosed_2017].

<!-- 

Although some aspects of static fMRI FC(particularlyICNs)areextremely robust to these choices, the choices may be of substantial consequence for cross-modal comparisons (e.g., cf. sensitivity of α-band neurophysiological FC to eyes open/closed condition; Gómez-Ramírez et al., 2017). https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15659-0

fMRI resting state stuff:

>“In this context, 60 most studies have focused on the acquisition of resting-state functional MRI to map the intrinsic 61 connectivity of neural networks. This choice is often prompted by three considerations. First, 62 intrinsic connectivity networks appear to be more heritable than task-elicited activity (Elliott et al., 63 2017; Ge et al., 2017; Winkler et al., 2010). Second, resting-state data are relatively easy to collect 64 from informative populations of children, the elderly, and mentally ill patients (Fox, 2010; 65 Greicius, 2008; Shehzad et al., 2009). Third, intrinsic connectivity plays a primary role in shaping 66 task-based brain activity and associated behaviors (Cole et al., 2016, 2014; Krienen et al., 2014; 67 Tavor et al., 2016).” ([Elliott et al., 2019, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/YMWLS5SX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYFVCMKV?page=3&annotation=M8QECJT6))


>“First, resting-state data are by nature heterogenous, and the resting-state is its own type of task 730 (Buckner et al., 2013). Researchers collect resting-state data under different conditions in which 731 participants close their eyes, have their eyes open, or fixate. These differences in resting-state 732 conditions influence intrinsic connectivity (Patriat et al., 2013).” ([Elliott et al., 2019, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/YMWLS5SX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YYFVCMKV?page=34&annotation=AY877R4E))

fMRI functional connectivity challenges: @bijsterboschetal_ChallengesFutureDirections_2020
-->

To date, two distinct modes of same-frequency intrinsic coupling have been identified throughout the EEG literature: *phase coupling* and *amplitude coupling* [@engeletal_IntrinsicCouplingModes_2013; @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020]. Phase coupling involves the timing of rhythmic neuronal activity and is defined as the coupling between the phases of two signals, estimated by the consistency of their phase angle differences (i.e., phase lags) over time [@mostamesadaghiani_PhaseAmplitudecouplingAre_2020; @stametal_PhaseLagIndex_2007]. Many distinct metrics have been developed to quantify phase coupling between two signals, each of which differ in their assumptions, motivations, availability in statistical software, and popular usage; however, what they have in common is their basic aim to capture and quantify different properties of the consistency of the distribution of phase angle differences over time [@bastosschoffelen_TutorialReviewFunctional_2016].[^2] To clarify this concept, we simulated two scenarios depicting how the consistency of phase angle differences behaves for phase-coupled signals (Figure \@ref(fig:phase-plot)A) and independent signals (Figure \@ref(fig:phase-plot)B). For Figure \@ref(fig:phase-plot)A, we generated two 5 Hz sinusoidal waves with an initial phase of 145 degrees (Signal 1) and 25 degrees (Signal 2) and uncorrelated Gaussian white noise added to each signal, then calculated the instantaneous phase angle difference between the signals at each time point. For Figure \@ref(fig:phase-plot)B, the instantaneous phase angle difference was instead calculated between Signal 1 and a third signal of Gaussian white noise (Signal 3). A narrow peak in the instantaneous phase angle difference distribution can be observed with the phase-coupled signals (Figure \@ref(fig:phase-plot)A), in contrast to the relatively even distribution of instantaneous phase angle differences with the independent signals (Figure \@ref(fig:phase-plot)B).

The polar histogram plots depict the distribution of instantaneous phase angle differences between phase-coupled Signals 1 and 2 (A) and independent Signals 1 and 3 (B); a narrow peak in the instantaneous phase angle difference distribution can be observed with the phase-coupled signals, in contrast to the relatively even distribution of instantaneous phase angle differences with the independent signals.

Stable, state-invariant local and long range phase coupling has been observed across all oscillatory bands at both zero and nonzero phase lags using a variety of phase coupling metrics [@engeletal_IntrinsicCouplingModes_2013]. The role of phase coupling in neuronal communication is fairly well-understood; as we described earlier, effective neuronal communication requires rhythmic synchronization within presynaptic and postsynaptic networks and coherence between them so that inputs consistently arrive during oscillatory phases of enhanced postsynaptic excitability, maximizing the probability they summate effectively and generate action potentials [@buzsaki_RhythmsBrain_2011; @buzsakiwatson_BrainRhythmsNeural_2012; @fries_RhythmsCognitionCommunication_2015; @singer_NeuronalOscillationsUnavoidable_2018]. Finally, we note that although it is also possible to assess phase coupling between fMRI BOLD signals [@honarietal_EvaluatingPhaseSynchronization_2021], these methods have not been used in the fMRI literature for network variant research; thus, phase coupling is generally regarded as a coupling mode unique to electrophysiological methods such as EEG and MEG [@engeletal_IntrinsicCouplingModes_2013].

Amplitude coupling involves the number of neurons active in a given rhythm and is defined as the coupling between the amplitude envelopes of two signals, estimated by the correlation of their amplitude envelopes over time [@brunsetal_AmplitudeEnvelopeCorrelation_2000; @hippetal_LargescaleCorticalCorrelation_2012; @mostamesadaghiani_PhaseAmplitudecouplingAre_2020]. This is similar in principle to fMRI BOLD functional connectivity analysis---wherein coupling between two BOLD signals is assessed by the correlation of their amplitudes over time---as both methods can be used to capture slow fluctuations in neural activity [@engeletal_IntrinsicCouplingModes_2013]. To clarify this concept, we simulated 1000 realizations of two amplitude modulated signals consisting of either a 30 Hz or 50 Hz sinusoidal wave modulated by a 3 Hz sinusoidal wave, with Gaussian white noise added to both the carrier and modulating waves; for each realization, we then estimated the absolute correlation coefficient between either the real signals or their amplitude envelopes. Figure \@ref(fig:amplitude-plot)A illustrates the basic mechanism behind amplitude modulation, wherein the phase dynamics of a low frequency signal modulates the amplitude of a higher frequency signal, and of how this is captured in the amplitude envelope of the amplitude modulated signal. Figure \@ref(fig:amplitude-plot)B displays the simulation results. A strong correlation can be observed between the low frequency amplitude envelopes of the two signals, in contrast to the correlations between the high frequency real signals which are clustered around zero.

Stable, state-invariant local and long range amplitude coupling has predominantly been observed at frequencies below 0.1 Hz (in terms of the amplitude envelope frequency) for both zero and nonzero phase lagged signals in all oscillatory bands [@buzsakiwatson_BrainRhythmsNeural_2012; @engeletal_IntrinsicCouplingModes_2013; @hippetal_LargescaleCorticalCorrelation_2012; @liuetal_LargescaleSpontaneousFluctuations_2010]. The role of amplitude coupling in neuronal communication is poorly understood; however, investigations comparing the spatiotemporal dynamics of phase coupling and amplitude coupling have found that the two coupling modes can occur independently of one another, with each mode containing common, but also complementary and divergent spatiotemporal dynamics under various conditions [@brunsetal_AmplitudeEnvelopeCorrelation_2000; @hindrikstewarie_DissociationPhasePower_2023; @mostamesadaghiani_PhaseAmplitudecouplingAre_2020; @siemssiegel_DissociatedNeuronalPhase_2020]. Thus, amplitude coupling is generally assumed to fulfill a dissociable function from phase coupling in neuronal communication [@engeletal_IntrinsicCouplingModes_2013; @heetal_ElectrophysiologicalBrainConnectivity_2019a]. Although more investigation is needed, a putative role of amplitude coupling based on several proposals is that high amplitude bursts in one population may be sufficient to make another population jump from low to high amplitude oscillatory activity---even when their phase and preferred frequencies are independent---providing a less restrictive, parallel mechanism for coordinating which neuronal populations participate in a functional network [@brookesetal_MeasuringFunctionalConnectivity_2011; @brunsetal_AmplitudeEnvelopeCorrelation_2000; @engeletal_IntrinsicCouplingModes_2013; @hindrikstewarie_DissociationPhasePower_2023; @mostamesadaghiani_PhaseAmplitudecouplingAre_2020].

## Individual differences and the functional organization of the human brain

Due to the highly individualistic trajectories of human brain development, the structural organization of neuronal networks varies greatly between individuals across the lifespan [@bateson_RobustnessPlasticityDevelopment_2017; @brown_IndividualDifferencesHuman_2017; @gukanai_WhatContributesIndividual_2014; @lewis_SelforganizingIndividualDifferences_2005]. Unsurprisingly, the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal activity unfolding upon this network also varies greatly between individuals, which has been known since various neuroimaging modalities---including EEG [e.g., @adrianmathews_BergerRhythmPotential_1934; @berger_UberElektrenkephalogrammMenschen_1929; @henry_ElectroencephalographicIndividualDifferences_1941] and fMRI [e.g., @rolandzilles_StructuralDivisionsFunctional_1998]---were first used to measure human brain activity. Despite this knowledge, network neuroscience research has mainly relied on group-averaged statistical approaches based on abstract models of the average human brain, wherein functional connectivity analysis is either performed on the concatenated recordings of all participants, or where functional connectivity estimates are averaged across participants [e.g., @poweretal_FunctionalNetworkOrganization_2011; @yeoetal_OrganizationHumanCerebral_2011]. Under these approaches, individual differences are typically treated as a nuisance factor to be eliminated [e.g., @brettetal_ProblemFunctionalLocalization_2002], and it is not uncommon for researchers using these approaches to commit an ecological fallacy [e.g., @caramazza_DrawingInferencesStructure_1986; @henson_WhatCanFunctional_2005], wrongly assuming that conclusions drawn from abstract models of the average human brain are universal and generalizable to (almost) every human brain [@vanhornetal_IndividualVariabilityBrain_2008; @viola_PlatonicBrainFacing_2020]. In turn, deviations from this abstract model are typically treated as either abnormal "outliers" or "noise" to be ruled out for the sake of generalizability [@vanhornetal_IndividualVariabilityBrain_2008; @viola_PlatonicBrainFacing_2020].

Previous work using these group-averaged statistical approaches has established that the human functional connectome is governed by an intrinsic functional architecture, wherein functional networks exhibit spontaneous coupling between their nodes that can be captured in both the absence and presence of cognitive demands [@foxetal_HumanBrainIntrinsically_2005; @petersensporns_BrainNetworksCognitive_2015; @poweretal_FunctionalNetworkOrganization_2011; @raichle_RestlessBrainHow_2015; @uddinetal_UniversalTaxonomyMacroscale_2019; @yeoetal_OrganizationHumanCerebral_2011]. Although consensus around the taxonomy of these networks is considerably variable [@uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023], many studies have replicated the presence of these networks across different samples [e.g., @poweretal_FunctionalNetworkOrganization_2011; @yeoetal_OrganizationHumanCerebral_2011] and with different neuroimaging modalities [@engeletal_IntrinsicCouplingModes_2013; @mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021; @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020], establishing that their organization is relatively stable when data are concatenated or averaged across groups of participants [@krausetal_InsightsPersonalizedModels_2023]. This work suggests that the human functional connectome is governed by some common organizational aspects across individuals, which can be measured using either fMRI or EEG/MEG.

Despite these commonalities, a growing body of evidence has found reliable and substantial interindividual variability in connectivity strength, the size and position of network nodes, and network topography across individuals [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @uddinetal_UniversalTaxonomyMacroscale_2019; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023]. Emphasizing the significance of these forms of interindividual variability to our understanding of whole brain functional network organization, @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023 write:

> Given this variation, how can we determine that a network is the same entity across different individuals or groups? If we find an individual missing specific components of Network A or with a spatial topography similar but slightly displaced relative to Network A, would it be accurate to call this Network A? In what ways, and to what extent, can a network vary but still represent the same underlying entity? To what extent should we expect certain networks to only be expressed in some individuals but not others? (p. 878)

Whether or not these individual differences constitute unique network entities or deviations from the same entities remains an open question; however, the implications of each of these forms of interindividual variability for interpreting measures of functional connectivity are clear: Without studying the functional connectomes of individuals to identify real, concrete examples of how much and in which ways people do and do not vary, our understanding of whole brain functional network organization and its relationship to behaviour, cognition, and their dysfunction will remain rather abstract and nebulous [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @naselarisetal_ExtensiveSamplingComplete_2021; @uddinetal_UniversalTaxonomyMacroscale_2019; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023; @vanhornetal_IndividualVariabilityBrain_2008].

It is only over the past decade that individual differences have become a topic of focus in network neuroscience research, as the field has begun to confront the challenges associated with developing and refining a taxonomy of whole brain functional networks---recognizing that developing a standardized taxonomy of whole brain functional networks requires an understanding of individual differences in functional connectome organization, and a clear assessment of the degree to which these differences affect our ability to identify common principles of organization across individuals [@dworetskyetal_ProbabilisticMappingHuman_2021; @gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @uddinetal_UniversalTaxonomyMacroscale_2019; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023]. These developments mark a substantial paradigm shift [@kuhnhacking_StructureScientificRevolutions_2012] in the basic efforts of network neuroscience research---away from the near-exclusive use of group-averaged statistical approaches based on abstract models of the average human brain (which by definition cannot represent the types of connectional, spatial, and topological variation found in individual brains), and towards individual-level approaches that seek to answer *how much* and *in which ways* whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals---and it is anticipated that the results of these efforts will lead to more robust, precise, and replicable accounts of the neural causes of variation in human behaviour, cognition, and their dysfunction [@elliottetal_WhatTestRetestReliability_2020; @fedorenko_EarlyOriginsGrowing_2021; @finnetal_CanBrainState_2017; @gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @grattonetal_BrainbehaviorCorrelationsTwo_2022; @uddinetal_UniversalTaxonomyMacroscale_2019; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023].[^3]

Much of the growing interest in individual-level approaches has been driven by large research consortia projects such as the Human Connectome Project [@elametal_HumanConnectomeProject_2021; @vanessenetal_HumanConnectomeProject_2012], which have made it feasible to study connectivity in whole brain functional networks across large numbers of people using high-quality open data; intensive (single-person) longitudinal studies such as the MyConnectome project [@poldracketal_LongtermNeuralPhysiological_2015], which have served as proofs of concept for studying within-individual change in connectivity over the course of days or months; technological and methodological advances that have made the characterization of brain function at an individual level possible with fMRI and EEG/MEG [for fMRI, see @duboisadolphs_BuildingScienceIndividual_2016; for EEG/MEG, see @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020]; a growing number of studies demonstrating that interindividual variability in connectivity strength, the size and position of network nodes, and network topography is the norm, *not* the exception, for the functional organization of the human brain [e.g., @bijsterboschetal_RelationshipSpatialConfiguration_2018; @finnetal_FunctionalConnectomeFingerprinting_2015; @gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @gordonetal_IndividualspecificFeaturesBrain_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @kongetal_SpatialTopographyIndividualSpecific_2019; @miranda-dominguezetal_ConnectotypingModelBased_2014; @muelleretal_IndividualVariabilityFunctional_2013; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019; @smithetal_BrainHubsDefined_2023]; and most recently, working groups within the network neuroscience community such as the Organization for Human Brain Mapping's Workgroup for Harmonized Taxonomy of Networks, who have identified interindividual variability as a key issue in building a standardized taxonomy of whole brain functional networks [@uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023].

Coinciding and resulting from these efforts, there has been an increased awareness over the past decade that although group-averaged statistical approaches based on abstract models of the average human brain can provide us with clues about common organizational aspects of the human functional connectome, they can also underestimate or entirely miss real features that can be reliably measured in individuals [@fedorenko_EarlyOriginsGrowing_2021; @fedorenkoblank_BrocaAreaNot_2020; @muelleretal_IndividualVariabilityFunctional_2013; @speelmanmcgann_HowMeanMean_2013; @zillesamunts_IndividualVariabilityNot_2013]. Likewise, these efforts have also found that although reliable brain-behaviour relationships can be identified using group-averaged statistical approaches such as cross-sectional designs, doing so requires large samples and the effect sizes underlying these relationships are typically small [@mareketal_ReproducibleBrainWideAssociation_2020]; whereas more robust brain-behaviour relationships can be identified in small, focused samples using individual-level approaches such as intensive (single-person) longitudinal designs with highly sampled neuroimaging data recorded over multiple sessions [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @grattonetal_BrainbehaviorCorrelationsTwo_2022; @naselarisetal_ExtensiveSamplingComplete_2021; @newboldetal_PlasticitySpontaneousActivity_2020]. Finally, it has become apparent that tasks originally developed to elicit robust group-averaged effects when contrasting specific experimental conditions (e.g., from cognitive neuroscience) have poor test-retest reliability when used to study individual differences [@elliottetal_WhatTestRetestReliability_2020]---highlighting the importance of selecting tasks which have been demonstrated to be reliable and valid for studying individual differences in functional connectivity, such as resting state or naturalistic paradigms [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017; @finnetal_IdiosynchronySharedResponses_2020; @finnbandettini_MoviewatchingOutperformsRest_2020], and more broadly, of developing and identifying tasks that can be used to bring out meaningful idiosyncrasies across individuals [@elliottetal_WhatTestRetestReliability_2020; @finnetal_CanBrainState_2017; @greeneetal_TaskinducedBrainState_2018; @krausetal_NetworkVariantsAre_2021]. Thus, studying network variants involves a shift in both the types of questions asked and the methods used to examine them relative to the group-averaged statistical approaches that have accounted for the vast majority of network neuroscience research to date---a shift that places focus on the individual as the primary unit of analysis [@fedorenko_EarlyOriginsGrowing_2021; @gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @grattonetal_BrainbehaviorCorrelationsTwo_2022; @krausetal_InsightsPersonalizedModels_2023; @naselarisetal_ExtensiveSamplingComplete_2021].

## Characterizing network variants

Although neurophysiological imaging modalities such as EEG have been identified as an important component to enrich our understanding of individual differences in whole brain functional network organization [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @sadaghianiwirsich_IntrinsicConnectomeOrganization_2020; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023], current characterizations of network variants are almost exclusively based on fMRI research methods. Below we discuss the key findings of this work, including: (1) methods that reliably capture individual whole brain functional networks; (2) what studies of individual whole brain functional networks reveal about common and idiosyncratic forms of organization; and (3) the relationship between individual whole brain functional networks and behaviour.

<!-- Methods that reliably capture individual whole brain functional networks -->

As we noted in the previous section, group-averaged statistical approaches to studying the human functional connectome have traditionally proceeded by either performing functional connectivity analysis on the concatenated recordings of all participants, or by averaging functional connectivity estimates across participants [e.g., @poweretal_FunctionalNetworkOrganization_2011; @yeoetal_OrganizationHumanCerebral_2011]. Moreover, in response to published recommendations, these approaches typically collect only a small amount of data per participant in terms of recording duration (e.g., 5-10 minutes), as this amount of data is generally sufficient to obtain reliable results when averaging across participants [@shehzadetal_RestingBrainUnconstrained_2009; @vandijketal_IntrinsicFunctionalConnectivity_2010]; however, doing so precludes the possibility of reliably characterizing whole brain functional network organization at an individual level due to the relatively low temporal signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI data [@andersonetal_ReproducibilitySingleSubjectFunctional_2011; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015; @xuetal_AssessingVariationsAreal_2016].

In contrast, capturing individual whole brain functional networks requires functional connectivity analysis and other measures of interest (e.g., graph theoretical measures) to be performed at an individual level prior to making any comparisons between individuals in order to preserve interindividual variability [@elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015]. The exact quantity of data needed for reliable individual-level estimation has been found to vary depending on the measure of interest and across different sampling methods [@andersonetal_ReproducibilitySingleSubjectFunctional_2011; @elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @hackeretal_RestingStateNetwork_2013; @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015; @nobleetal_InfluencesTestRetest_2017]. For example, @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017 found that, on average, a minimum of 30 minutes of eyes open resting state data (retained after motion correction) was required to achieve reliable functional connectivity estimates across participants ($r > .85$); whereas reliable network assignment using community detection algorithms required a minimum of 90 minutes (Dice coefficient $> .75$), and other graph theoretic measures (participation coefficient, global efficiency, and modularity) required a minimum of anywhere from 10 to 80 minutes. With less than 10 minutes of resting state data all measures yielded low reliability estimates, as well as systematic bias for graph theoretical measures. Additionally, @elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019, @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015, and @nobleetal_InfluencesTestRetest_2017 each found that similar or greater reliability could be obtained by acquiring shorter recordings over more sessions compared to longer recordings over fewer sessions (e.g., 15 minutes from two sessions compared to 30 minutes from one session) when combining recordings into a single data set.

Together, these results emphasize the importance of collecting sufficient data per participant to counteract the sampling variability of the fMRI BOLD signal and obtain reliable estimates at an individual level [@andersonetal_ReproducibilitySingleSubjectFunctional_2011; @elliottetal_GeneralFunctionalConnectivity_2019; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @hackeretal_RestingStateNetwork_2013; @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015; @nobleetal_InfluencesTestRetest_2017]. Additionally, care is needed when collecting and preprocessing these data, as non-neural artifacts such as motion [@poweretal_SpuriousSystematicCorrelations_2012; @poweretal_MethodsDetectCharacterize_2014; @poweretal_CriticalEventRelatedAppraisal_2020; @satterthwaiteetal_ImpactInscannerHead_2012; @vandijketal_InfluenceHeadMotion_2012], respiration [@birnetal_RespirationResponseFunction_2008; @changglover_RelationshipRespirationEndtidal_2009], and signal loss due to acquisition parameters, head shape or head position [@nobleetal_InfluencesTestRetest_2017] can also induce unintentional interindividual variability in functional connectivity [@uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023].

<!-- What studies of individual whole brain functional networks reveal about common and idiosyncratic forms of organization -->

When such confounds are adequately addressed, it becomes evident that at least three different forms of reliable and substantial interindividual variability are present in individual whole brain functional networks: connectivity strength, the size and position of network nodes, and network topography [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @uddinetal_UniversalTaxonomyMacroscale_2019; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023]. Connectivity strength---the magnitude of BOLD signal coupling between nodes---is the most commonly studied form of interindividual variability [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023]. Interindividual variability in connectivity strength has been found to be largely stable over time and across different tasks, suggesting that the majority of whole brain functional network organization arises from stable factors involved in individualistic developmental trajectories (e.g., genetic, environmental, and psychological differences; developmental histories; etc.), rather than more transient factors (e.g., ongoing cognition, day-to-day fluctuations, etc.) [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @krausetal_NetworkVariantsAre_2021].[^4] The relative magnitude of these differences has been found to be large enough that functional connectome similarities are consistently greater within than between individuals [@gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018] to such an extent that (1) functional connectomes from the same individual can be accurately matched when comparing a given individual's connectome against all other connectomes in a sample across scan conditions [@finnetal_FunctionalConnectomeFingerprinting_2015; @finnetal_CanBrainState_2017], and over months, years, and the lifespan [@jalbrzikowskietal_FunctionalConnectomeFingerprinting_2020; @horienetal_IndividualFunctionalConnectome_2019; @st-ongeetal_FunctionalConnectomeFingerprinting_2023]; and (2) the functional network affiliation of a given network node can vary across individuals, even when that node is spatially consistent across individuals [@gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021].

Spatial variability in the size and position of network nodes represents a second form of interindividual variability [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023]. It is well-established that cortical areas vary in their size, shape, and location across individuals, even after precise surface-based anatomical alignment [@frostgoebel_MeasuringStructuralFunctional_2012; @vanessenetal_ParcellationsHemisphericAsymmetries_2012]; thus, it follows that this spatial variability would also be present in the organization of functional networks across individuals [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021]. Indeed, such spatial variability has been repeatedly found throughout the cortex [@gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @harrisonetal_LargescaleProbabilisticFunctional_2015; @kongetal_SpatialTopographyIndividualSpecific_2019; @lietal_PerformingGrouplevelFunctional_2019; @wangetal_ParcellatingCorticalFunctional_2015], taking the form of areal expansions, contractions, or displacements of network nodes that lead to variation in (1) the exact positions of functional network borders across individuals; and (2) the functional network affiliation of a given network node across individuals [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023]. The relative magnitude of this variability has been found to be large enough that many details of functional network organization are lost when using group-averaged approaches (e.g., the fractionation of larger networks into parallel distributed subnetworks), such that these features can only be identified at an individual level [@bragaetal_ParallelDistributedNetworks_2019; @bragabuckner_ParallelInterdigitatedDistributed_2017; @dinicolaetal_ParallelDistributedNetworks_2020; @gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @gordonetal_DefaultmodeNetworkStreams_2020; @gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021]. Additionally, at an individual level, areal expansions and contractions appear to be interdependent within and between functional networks, such that (1) nodes of the same functional network tend to expand or contract together; and (2) the relative expansion of a given functional network tends to reduce the amount of cortex available to other adjacent, connected functional networks [@gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017].

Neither connectional nor spatial variability appear to be evenly distributed throughout the cortex---instead there appears to be a characteristic distribution of interindividual variability across individuals, such that certain functional networks and network nodes show greater individualization than others [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]. For example, recent work suggests that functional networks associated with higher-level functions show greater individualization than functional networks associated with sensorimotor processing [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @muelleretal_IndividualVariabilityFunctional_2013; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]; that nodes near the borders of functional networks previously described using group-averaged approaches tend to have more variable network affiliations across individuals than nodes that are not near borders [@gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017]; and that individuals can be separated into trait-like subgroups based on similar distributions of interindividual variability in connectivity strength or the size and position of network nodes [@gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]. Together, these findings suggest that the interindividual variability described thus far stems from (systematic) individual deviations from a basic organizing structure that is common across individuals [@gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019].

Indeed, an important assumption when studying each of the previous forms of interindividual variability is that every individual functional connectome has the same network topography---that is, they each have the same set of matched network nodes [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021]. These nodes may vary in their connectivity strength, size, position, or even their functional network affiliations, however, ultimately they are assumed to represent the same cortical components across individuals, making direct comparisons between individuals possible [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021]. This assumption is broadly supported in the literature. Although reliable and substantial interindividual variability is present in whole brain functional networks, these networks also appear to share common organizing principles across individuals, such that individuals largely seem to have the same set of functional networks composed of the same sets of network nodes [@gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017]. For example, recent work has found that the boundaries between the default mode network and other functional networks can be readily identified within individuals [@bragaetal_ParallelDistributedNetworks_2019; @bragabuckner_ParallelInterdigitatedDistributed_2017; @dinicolaetal_ParallelDistributedNetworks_2020; @gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @gordonetal_DefaultmodeNetworkStreams_2020; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023], in line with the idea that a common basic organizing structure exists across individuals [@gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019].

However, on a local level, interindividual variability in network topography can cause single cortical areas representing network nodes---which appear unitary in group-averaged data and most individuals---to split into multiple discontinuous regions, creating apparent extra network nodes in every individual that are not typically present in other individuals [@glasseretal_MultimodalParcellationHuman_2016; @gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023]. In some cases, these apparent extra network nodes have been found to exhibit the same properties as the unitary area [@glasseretal_MultimodalParcellationHuman_2016]; however, in others these nodes have been found to exhibit strong, idiosyncratic connectivity with a functional network different from the one they are situated within [@gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021; @laumannetal_FunctionalSystemAreal_2015; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023]. As @gordonnelson_ThreeTypesIndividual_2021 explain, the interpretation of this third form of interindividual variability is currently unclear, as it represents network nodes that are so connectionally and spatially divergent from group-averaged data and most other individuals that they may not be classifiable using existing approaches: Topographical variability may simply represent extreme examples of the spatial or connectional variability described above, or it may indeed represent cortical components that do not exist in the networks of most other individuals. Such possibilities remain to be investigated in future work.

<!-- The relationship between individual whole brain functional networks, structure, and behaviour -->

An important question for studies of network variants is whether or not interindividual variability in connectivity strength, the size and position of network nodes, or network topography relates to individual differences in behaviour, cognition, and their dysfunction [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]. One possibility is that this interindividual variability is functionally significant, with at least some aspects of this variability interacting within individuals to produce differences in behaviour and cognition [@gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]. Conversely, an alternative possibility is that this interindividual variability is functionally degenerate [@fristonprice_DegeneracyRedundancyCognitive_2003; @tononietal_MeasuresDegeneracyRedundancy_1999; @pricefriston_DegeneracyCognitiveAnatomy_2002]---that is, this variability may represent diverse but equivalently effective modes of functional organization, such that equivalent behavioural and cognitive outcomes may be instantiated by different patterns of organization [@gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019].

Although such possibilities have yet to be directly addressed, several studies have demonstrated that predictive models trained on features derived from connectivity strength, network size, and network topography can be used to predict individual differences in behaviour and cognition in novel participants. For example, features derived from connectivity strength have been demonstrated to predict individual differences in age [@pervaizetal_OptimisingNetworkModelling_2020], sex [@pervaizetal_OptimisingNetworkModelling_2020], fluid intelligence scores [@finnetal_FunctionalConnectomeFingerprinting_2015; @greeneetal_TaskinducedBrainState_2018; @pervaizetal_OptimisingNetworkModelling_2020], composite scores of cognition and emotion [@finnbandettini_MoviewatchingOutperformsRest_2020], neuroticism scores [@pervaizetal_OptimisingNetworkModelling_2020], sustained attention ability [@rosenbergetal_NeuromarkerSustainedAttention_2016], and changes in attentional state over minutes, days, weeks, and months [@rosenbergetal_BehavioralNeuralSignatures_2020]. Features derived from network size and network topography have been demonstrated to predict individual differences in scores on several cognition, personality, and emotion measures [@kongetal_SpatialTopographyIndividualSpecific_2019]. Together these results suggest that all three of these forms of interindividual variability may indeed be functionally significant for a wide range of behavioural and cognitive measures. However, in order to move us closer to an understanding of how much and in which ways these forms of variability may interact within individuals to produce differences in behaviour and cognition, further research is needed to characterize these relationships with greater precision, accuracy, and detail [@finnrosenberg_FingerprintingChoosingPredictive_2021; @mantwilletal_BrainConnectivityFingerprinting_2022; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019; @wuetal_ChallengesProspectsBrainbased_2023].

## The present study

The purpose of the present study is to explore the feasibility of studying network variants with EEG across several canonical frequency bands using measures of both phase coupling and amplitude coupling. To address this question, we used EEG data from fourteen participants previously collected by our lab as part of a larger study, containing a total of 30 minutes eyes open resting state data (over 6 recordings) and 30 minutes eyes closed resting state data (over 6 recordings) from each participant collected during three sessions over the course of approximately three months. Each session consisted of four 5-minute recordings (2 eyes open, 2 eyes closed), with the time between sessions ranging from approximately one to two weeks from the first to second session, and approximately three months from the second to third session. With this design we were able to explore how functional connectomes differed within and between individuals, sessions, and states, and thus, whether or not higher frequency functional connectomes measured with EEG share similar evidence of stable individual differences to what has been described in the fMRI literature [e.g., @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018]. Specifically, we were interested in how much and in which ways patterns of sensor-space connectivity strength varied within and between individuals across these different contexts.

To facilitate these comparisons, we estimated the strength of sensor-space connectivity using the phase lag index [PLI\; @stametal_PhaseLagIndex_2007] and the orthogonalized amplitude envelope correlation [AEC\; @hippetal_LargescaleCorticalCorrelation_2012], which measure phase coupling and amplitude coupling, respectively. We then used matrix correlations to quantify the similarity between pairs of functional connectomes, reducing the dimensionality of these data to a single interpretable number suitable for subsequent analyses, which served as an index of (inter)individual differences in underlying global network activity. These correlations take values between 0 (no linear relationship) and 1 (perfect linear relationship), defining a scale of similarity between two functional connectomes that can be interpreted in a straightforward manner in much the same way as the familiar squared Pearson correlation coefficient [@josseholmes_MeasuringMultivariateAssociation_2016; @mayeretal_ExploratoryAnalysisMultiple_2011].

This dataset was particularly well-suited to address this question, given that we had sufficient data per participant, session, and state to examine how functional connectome similarity differed within and between individuals across contexts via the interaction of (1) session-dependent variability over the course of weeks and months, and (2) state-dependent variability over the course of minutes during different resting states. Figure \@ref(fig:similarity-archetype-plots) depicts six hypothetical outcomes we could find based on different assumptions about the underlying global network activity. The left column shows outcomes that would occur in cases where functional connectomes *do not* differ between individuals. In particular, we might expect to see (1) a *group effect* with high similarity among all measurements regardless of individual, session, or state, which might occur if the underlying activity we measured is largely intrinsic and common across individuals [cf. @raichle_TwoViewsBrain_2010]; (2) a *group-session effect* with high similarity among all measurements regardless of individual or state, but not session, which might occur if the underlying activity we measured is largely intrinsic, common across individuals, and varies over time in the same way across individuals; or (3) a *group-state effect* with high similarity among all measurements regardless of individual or session, but not state, which might occur if the underlying activity we measured is largely reactive in a way that is common across individuals [cf. @raichle_TwoViewsBrain_2010]. The right column shows outcomes that would occur in cases where functional connectomes *do* differ between individuals. In particular, we might expect to see (4) an *individual effect* with high similarity among all measurements regardless of session or state, but not individual, which might occur if the underlying activity we measured is largely intrinsic and unique within individuals; (5) an *individual-session effect* with high similarity among all measurements regardless of state, but not individual or session, which might occur if the underlying activity we measured is largely intrinsic, unique within individuals, and varies over time within individuals; or (6) an *individual-state effect* with high similarity among all measurements regardless of session, but not individual or state, which might occur if the underlying activity we measured is largely reactive in a way that is unique within individuals.

To quantify these effects, we used pairwise contrasts to estimate the direction and magnitude of differences in functional connectome similarity within and between individuals across sessions and states. Figure \@ref(fig:contrasts-plot) illustrates these contrasts as they relate to the six hypothetical outcomes depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:similarity-archetype-plots) above. These contrasts were the estimands [i.e., the target quantities\; @lundbergetal_WhatYourEstimand_2021] of this study, with differences estimated for (1) the overall difference in similarity within and between participants, which we term the *main effect*; (2) the difference in similarity within and between participants for each level of one predictor (e.g., within session similarity) while averaging over levels of the other predictor (e.g., within and between state similarity); (3) the difference in similarity within and between participants for the unique combinations within and between session and state. As Figure \@ref(fig:contrasts-plot) makes clear, when there are equal amounts of functional connectome similarity within and between participants (i.e., when the underlying activity is common across individuals) there is zero difference in functional connectome similarity within versus between participants regardless of the underlying group, session, or state effects; however, when functional connectomes are more similar within than between participants (i.e., when the underlying activity is unique within individuals) there is a positive, non-zero difference which varies according to the type of individual effect (individual, individual-session, or individual-state effects). Thus, under this approach, a necessary condition for network variants to be detected is a positive, non-zero difference in functional connectome similarity.

Here we focus on the estimation of the direction, strength, and uncertainty of these effects in our sample---explicitly refraining from a null-hypothesis significance testing approach in favour of an estimation approach [@berneramrhein_WhyHowWe_2021]. We favour an estimation approach for the following reasons: First, as we illustrated in Figures \@ref(fig:similarity-archetype-plots) and \@ref(fig:contrasts-plot), the motivation behind the present study was the exploration of broad empirical questions about how much and in which ways functional connectome similarity differed within and between individuals across sessions and states, which requires an approach describing and discussing the range of effect sizes that are most compatible with our data (given our background model), rather than the testing of narrow hypotheses that could either be "rejected" or "accepted" [@amrheinetal_InferentialStatisticsDescriptive_2019; @amrheinetal_ScientistsRiseStatistical_2019; @amrheingreenland_DiscussPracticalImportance_2022; @berneramrhein_WhyHowWe_2021]. Second, as numerous statisticians and scientists have warned for decades, the abuse of ritualistic dichotomous inference in lieu of statistical thinking across scientific disciplines has created a crisis of validity for scientific conclusions, including their replicability [@gigerenzer_StatisticalRitualsReplication_2018; @wassersteinetal_MovingWorld05_2019; @wassersteinlazar_ASAStatementPValues_2016]. Rather than contribute to this crisis, we recognize that the primary scientific contribution of the present study is the estimation of the direction, strength, and uncertainty of individual differences in functional connectome similarity in our sample; whereas meta-analytic studies and other cumulative approaches that combine information from multiple studies---each with their own set of conditions, assumptions, patterns of variation, and sources of systematic error---will typically be required to come to more generalized scientific conclusions about electrophysiological network variants [@amrheinetal_InferentialStatisticsDescriptive_2019; @berneramrhein_WhyHowWe_2021; @nicholsetal_AccumulatingEvidenceEcology_2019; @nicholsetal_BetterApproachDealing_2021]. 

It is likely that the real data will be representative of more than one of the hypothetical outcomes illustrated in Figures \@ref(fig:similarity-archetype-plots) and \@ref(fig:contrasts-plot). Figure \@ref(fig:outcome-plot) illustrates what this might look like should the individual, individual-session, and individual-state effects be equally represented in the underlying global network activity, based on the simple averaging of each effects' contrasts. We emphasize that this illustration represents an unrealistic scenario where each individual's functional connectomes are perfectly similar with themselves and perfectly dissimilar with others; therefore, the magnitude of these effect sizes is greatly exaggerated. In reality, we would expect to find smaller effect sizes whose magnitudes decrease as the dynamics of underlying global network activity becomes more similar across individuals. Moreover, it is rather unlikely that the individual, individual-session, and individual-state effects would be equally weighted; thus, we would also expect to find an additional degree of variation in this hypothetical pattern of results based on the relative contribution of these effects to the stability of functional connectome similarity within individuals across sessions and states [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018]. We illustrate the relative influence of these effects in the second, third, and fourth plots of Figure \@ref(fig:outcome-plot). In the second plot we see that as the individual effect makes a greater relative contribution, the magnitude of effect sizes across all contrasts becomes greater; whereas, in the third and fourth plots we see that as either the individual-session or individual-state effects make a greater relative contribution, an additional degree of effect size variation appears with both more and less pronounced differences in functional connectome similarity occurring across sessions and states.

Based on the findings of previous fMRI network variant research [e.g., @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019], we expected to find patterns of results consistent with the fourth plot in Figure \@ref(fig:outcome-plot) across all frequency bands for both phase coupling and amplitude coupling functional connectomes---consistent with functional connectomes that were more similar within than between individuals across all contrasts, with greater variations in similarity related to state than session. However, we emphasize that any of the result patterns depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:outcome-plot) would provide supportive evidence of stable individual differences in EEG functional connectomes, albeit with somewhat different interpretations as we described above for the individual, individual-session, and individual-state effects. Thus, our primary scientific hypothesis was that if the phase coupling and/or amplitude coupling dynamics of underlying global network activity in a given frequency band was influenced by stable individual-dependent factors *in our sample*, then functional connectomes would be more similar within than between individuals across all contrasts, on average, with smaller variations in similarity related to session or state.

We had no expectations regarding the possible range of effect sizes we could find, but again note that relatively higher values correspond to greater within-individual functional connectome stability and between-individual differentiation across contexts, whereas relatively lower values correspond to lesser within-individual functional connectome stability and between-individual differentiation. Thus, we reiterate the importance of considering the range of effect sizes most compatible with our data (given our background model) when drawing conclusions about our primary scientific hypothesis, rather than merely drawing conclusions based on the direction of these effects and whether or not they included zero [@amrheinetal_InferentialStatisticsDescriptive_2019]. Additionally, to contextualize our results against the relevant fMRI literature, we considered the results of @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018 as a cautious point of reference, keeping in mind that finding equivalent effect sizes would be surprising, given the differences in measurement, design, and analysis between our studies, on top of random variation in the data between our samples. In their study, @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018 investigated how functional connectome similarity---measured using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the vectorized lower triangles of each functional connectome pair---differed within and between individuals across ten separate fMRI sessions and five different states (eyes-open resting state, and visual coherence, semantic, memory, and motor tasks). They found that functional connectomes were more similar within participants than between participants across contexts, on average, at both the group-level and individual-level by approximately 0.2 points ($\mathrm{Mean_{within}} = 0.556$, $\mathrm{Mean_{between}} = 0.357$) on the response scale when functional connectivity was estimated at the recording level, and by approximately 0.3 points ($\mathrm{Mean_{within}} = 0.795$, $\mathrm{Mean_{between}} = 0.512$) on the response scale when functional connectivity was estimated using the split-half method (see, respectively, Figures S2 and 3 in @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018).[^5] A similarity matrix for the eyes-open resting state functional connectomes from this sample was also reported by this group of researchers in a separate study, which showed individual differences in functional connectome similarity of a similar magnitude across sessions to those discussed above (see Figure 2H in @gordonetal_PrecisionFunctionalMapping_2017).

Finally, given our focus on individual differences, we considered it naturally important to investigate outcome variability of these effects across participants; particularly because network variants have been characterized as a common phenomenon present in all individuals, rather than an idiosyncrasy of just a few individuals [@seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]. This served as a compliment to the group-level analysis of individual differences described above, allowing us to evaluate whether the group-level outcomes we observed would hold at the level of individuals (i.e., the level of observation where these differences originated from) in terms of the direction of these effects. Indeed, a central aim of investigating outcome variability was to dispel any misconceptions about the implications of our findings that could be caused by focusing only on the group-level outcomes---which can lead even highly trained experts to overestimate the importance and generalizability of findings due to uncertainty about average effects often being quite precise even in the presence of substantial outcome variability [@zhangetal_IllusionPredictabilityScientific_2022].

[^1]: Although the nodes of fMRI functional networks can also include subcortical and cerebellar brain regions, we adopt a cortico-centric definition of whole brain functional networks here for inclusivity with EEG/MEG functional networks, which are generally limited to measuring cortical activity. This definition is not particularly limiting to the present discussion, as contemporary fMRI investigations largely ignore subcortical and cerebellar brain regions anyways [@uddinetal_UniversalTaxonomyMacroscale_2019; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023], and the fMRI network variant research to date has focused exclusively on cortical connectivity.

[^99]: It is important to note that such naming conventions should not be taken to mean that these networks are solely involved in the putative function(s) associated with their assigned name or category [@uddinetal_UniversalTaxonomyMacroscale_2019; @yeoetal_OrganizationHumanCerebral_2011], as multiple networks may be involved in the same function(s) (i.e., many-to-one mapping) and singular networks may be involved in multiple functions [i.e., one-to-many mapping\; @pessoa_UnderstandingBrainNetworks_2014].

[^2]: Mathematical details and discussion of several widely used phase coupling metrics can be found in a review by @bastosschoffelen_TutorialReviewFunctional_2016.

[^3]: For historically interested readers, this renewed interest in individual differences for network neuroscience research is much akin to Cronbach's [-@cronbach_TwoDisciplinesScientific_1957] treatise on the historic separation of scientific psychology into two distinct disciplines---the so-called *experimental* and *correlational* disciplines, which broadly speaking studied variance only among either  treatments or individuals, respectively---and the need for these disciplines to combine their efforts if the field ever hopes to solve its most important problems. Similar reflections are now being seen in the field of network neuroscience, as researchers increasingly recognize the importance of studying the variation that already exists between and within individuals to further our understanding of the human brain [e.g., @elliottetal_WhatTestRetestReliability_2020; @grattonetal_BrainbehaviorCorrelationsTwo_2022; @uddinetal_UniversalTaxonomyMacroscale_2019; @uddinetal_ControversiesProgressStandardization_2023].

[^4]: To be clear, this is not to say that brain state or time have no influence on interindividual variability in connectivity strength. Indeed, the relative magnitude of functional connectome similarities within and between individuals has been found to vary moderately by behavioural or cognitive state and mildly by time such that individualization is measurably greater during certain brain states than others, and slightly greater for recordings taken during the same session [@finnetal_CanBrainState_2017; @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018; @seitzmanetal_TraitlikeVariantsHuman_2019]. However, this influence is considerably smaller relative to the influence contributed by individuals themselves [@grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018].

[^5]: These values correspond to the *main effect* contrasts in our study and were obtained by back-transforming the Fisher-transformed Pearson correlation coefficients for the group and individual effects reported in @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018, then taking their difference. For the split-half method, functional connectivity was estimated for each individual and task on the basis of two 5-session groups (by concatenating the recordings from a given task in each group together to increase the reliability of functional connectivity estimates), rather than at the recording level (for further details, see @grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018).
