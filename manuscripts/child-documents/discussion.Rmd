# Discussion

Overall, we found that in our sample, contingent on the correctness of all background assumptions used to compute our estimates, EEG is generally poor at detecting network variants in both phase- and amplitude-based functional connectomes, regardless of frequency band. Where we did find evidence supportive of network variants (phase-coupling in the alpha band), effects were small and inconsistent across participants.

That said, one thing we do see is that the group-level similarity estimates follow the general pattern we would expect based on common sense (the more "within" we get, the more similarity there is)

## Things to talk about

Higher density EEG caps

Testing concurrent EEG and fMRI to rule out sample issues

Trying different connectivity measures

Recording length

Statistical limitations

Generalizability

Contrast results with those from @mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021

we find little evidence of network variants in both phase and amplitude functional connectomes across frequency bands, given the correctness of all assumptions in our model.
