  {"id":"abreuetal_OptimizingEEGSource_2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Reconstructing EEG sources involves a complex pipeline, with the inverse problem being the most challenging. Multiple inversion algorithms are being continuously developed, aiming to tackle the non-uniqueness of this problem, which has been shown to be partially circumvented by including prior information in the inverse models. Despite a few efforts, there are still current and persistent controversies regarding the inversion algorithm of choice and the optimal set of spatial priors to be included in the inversion models. The use of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data is one approach to tackle this problem. The spatial resolution of fMRI makes fMRI derived spatial priors very convenient for EEG reconstruction, however, only task activation maps and resting-state networks (RSNs) have been explored so far, overlooking the recent, but already accepted, notion that brain networks exhibit dynamic functional connectivity fluctuations. The lack of a systematic comparison between different source reconstruction algorithms, considering potentially more brain-informative priors such as fMRI, motivates the search for better reconstruction models. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data, here we compared four different inversion algorithms (minimum norm, MN; low resolution electromagnetic tomography, LORETA; empirical Bayes beamformer, EBB; and multiple sparse priors, MSP) under a Bayesian framework (as implemented in SPM), each with three different sets of priors consisting of: (1) those specific to the algorithm; (2) those specific to the algorithm plus fMRI task activation maps and RSNs; and (3) those specific to the algorithm plus fMRI task activation maps and RSNs and network modules of task-related dFC states estimated from the dFC fluctuations. The quality of the reconstructed EEG sources was quantified in terms of model-based metrics, namely the expectation of the posterior probability\n              P\n              (model|data) and variance explained of the inversion models, and the overlap/proportion of brain regions known to be involved in the visual perception tasks that the participants were submitted to, and RSN templates, with/within EEG source components. Model-based metrics suggested that model parsimony is preferred, with the combination MSP and priors specific to this algorithm exhibiting the best performance. However, optimal overlap/proportion values were found using EBB and priors specific to this algorithm and fMRI task activation maps and RSNs or MSP and considering all the priors (algorithm priors, fMRI task activation maps and RSNs and dFC state modules), respectively, indicating that fMRI spatial priors, including dFC state modules, might contain useful information to recover EEG source components reflecting neuronal activity of interest. Our main results show that providing fMRI spatial derived priors that reflect the dynamics of the brain might be useful to map neuronal activity more accurately from EEG-fMRI. Furthermore, this work paves the way towards a more informative selection of the optimal EEG source reconstruction approach, which may be critical in future studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Abreu","given":"Rodolfo"},{"family":"Soares","given":"Júlia F."},{"family":"Lima","given":"Ana Cláudia"},{"family":"Sousa","given":"Lívia"},{"family":"Batista","given":"Sónia"},{"family":"Castelo-Branco","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Duarte","given":"João Valente"}],"citation-key":"abreuetal_OptimizingEEGSource_2022","container-title":"Brain Topography","container-title-short":"Brain Topogr","DOI":"10.1007/s10548-022-00891-3","ISSN":"0896-0267, 1573-6792","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"language":"en","page":"282-301","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Optimizing EEG Source Reconstruction with Concurrent fMRI-Derived Spatial Priors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10548-022-00891-3","volume":"35"},

Locations of these dipoles were then estimated using gradient descent within five template head models fit to the electrode positions. These were: a spherical model, three-layer and four-layer BEM head models based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template head image, and these BEM models warped to the recorded electrode positions. Smallest localization errors (4.1–6.2 mm, medians) were obtained using the electrode-position warped four-layer BEM models, with largest localization errors (~20 mm) for most basal brain locations. When we increased the brain-to-skull conductivity ratio assumed in the template model scalp projections from the simulated value (25:1) to a higher value (80:1) used in earlier studies, the estimated dipole locations moved outwards (12.4 mm, median). We also investigated the effects of errors in co-registering the electrode positions, of reducing electrode counts, and of adding a fifth, isotropic white matter layer to one individual head model. Results show that when individual subject MR head images are not available to construct subject-specific head models, accurate EEG source localization should employ a four- or five-layer BEM template head model incorporating an accurate skull conductivity estimate and warped to 64 or more accurately 3-D measured and co-registered electrode positions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Akalin Acar","given":"Zeynep"},{"family":"Makeig","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"akalinacarmakeig_EffectsForwardModel_2013","container-title":"Brain Topography","container-title-short":"Brain Topogr","DOI":"10.1007/s10548-012-0274-6","ISSN":"0896-0267, 1573-6792","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"language":"en","page":"378-396","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of Forward Model Errors on EEG Source Localization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10548-012-0274-6","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"amrheinetal_InferentialStatisticsDescriptive_2019","abstract":"Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a “replication crisis” may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Amrhein","given":"Valentin"},{"family":"Trafimow","given":"David"},{"family":"Greenland","given":"Sander"}],"citation-key":"amrheinetal_InferentialStatisticsDescriptive_2019","container-title":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1080/00031305.2018.1543137","ISSN":"0003-1305","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,29]]},"page":"262-270","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Inferential Statistics as Descriptive Statistics: There Is No Replication Crisis if We Don’t Expect Replication","title-short":"Inferential Statistics as Descriptive Statistics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2018.1543137","volume":"73"},

  {"id":"amrheingreenland_DiscussPracticalImportance_2022","abstract":"It has long been argued that we need to consider much more than an observed point estimate and a p-value to understand statistical results. One of the most persistent misconceptions about p-values is that they are necessarily calculated assuming a null hypothesis of no effect is true. Instead, p-values can and should be calculated for multiple hypothesized values for the effect size. For example, a p-value function allows us to visualize results continuously by examining how the p-value varies as we move across possible effect sizes. For more focused discussions, a 95% confidence interval shows the subset of possible effect sizes that have p-values larger than 0.05 as calculated from the same data and the same background statistical assumptions. In this sense a confidence interval can be taken as showing the effect sizes that are most compatible with the data, given the assumptions, and thus may be better termed a compatibility interval. The question that should then be asked is whether any or all of the effect sizes within the interval are substantial enough to be of practical importance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Amrhein","given":"Valentin"},{"family":"Greenland","given":"Sander"}],"citation-key":"amrheingreenland_DiscussPracticalImportance_2022","container-title":"Journal of Information Technology","container-title-short":"Journal of Information Technology","DOI":"10.1177/02683962221105904","ISSN":"0268-3962","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"language":"en","page":"02683962221105904","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Discuss practical importance of results based on interval estimates and p-value functions, not only on point estimates and null p-values","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/02683962221105904"},
  {"id":"andersonetal_ReproducibilitySingleSubjectFunctional_2011","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Measurements of resting-state functional connectivity have increasingly been used for characterization of neuropathologic and neurodevelopmental populations. We collected data to characterize how much imaging time is necessary to obtain reproducible quantitative functional connectivity measurements needed for a reliable single-subject diagnostic test.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained 100 five-minute BOLD scans on a single subject, divided into 10 sessions of 10 scans each, with the subject at rest or while watching video clips of cartoons. These data were compared with resting-state BOLD scans from 36 healthy control subjects by evaluating the correlation between each pair of 64 small spheric regions of interest obtained from a published functional brain parcellation.\nRESULTS: Single-subject and group data converged to reliable estimates of individual and population connectivity values proportional to 1 / sqrt(n). Dramatic improvements in reliability were seen by using ≤25 minutes of imaging time, with smaller improvements for additional time. Functional connectivity “fingerprints” for the individual and population began diverging at approximately 15 minutes of imaging time, with increasing reliability even at 4 hours of imaging time. Twenty-five minutes of BOLD imaging time was required before any individual connections could reliably discriminate an individual from a group of healthy control subjects. A classifier discriminating scans during which our subject was resting or watching cartoons was 95% accurate at 10 minutes and 100% accurate at 15 minutes of imaging time.\nCONCLUSIONS: An individual subject and control population converged to reliable different functional connectivity profiles that were task-modulated and could be discriminated with sufficient imaging time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"J.

  {"id":"azevedoetal_EqualNumbersNeuronal_2009","abstract":"The human brain is often considered to be the most cognitively capable among mammalian brains and to be much larger than expected for a mammal of our body size. Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 +/- 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells (\"neurons\") and 84.6 +/- 9.8 billion NeuN-negative (\"nonneuronal\") cells. With only 19% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.","author":[{"family":"Azevedo","given":"Frederico A.

First, we review metrics for functional connectivity, including coherence, phase synchronization, phase-slope index, and Granger causality, with the specific aim to provide an intuition for how these metrics work, as well as their quantitative definition. Next, we highlight a number of interpretational caveats and common pitfalls that can arise when performing functional connectivity analysis, including the common reference problem, the signal to noise ratio problem, the volume conduction problem, the common input problem, and the trial sample size bias problem.

  {"id":"berneramrhein_WhyHowWe_2021","abstract":"A paradigm shift away from null hypothesis significance testing seems in progress. Based on simulations, we illustrate some of the underlying motivations. First, P-values vary strongly from study to study, hence dichotomous inference using significance thresholds is usually unjustified. Second, statistically significant results have overestimated effect sizes, a bias declining with increasing statistical power. Third, statistically non-significant results have underestimated effect sizes, and this bias gets stronger with higher statistical power. Fourth, the tested statistical hypotheses generally lack biological justification and are often uninformative. Despite these problems, a screen of 48 papers from the 2020 volume of the Journal of Evolutionary Biology exemplifies that significance testing is still used almost universally in evolutionary biology. All screened studies tested the default null hypothesis of zero effect with the default significance threshold of p = 0.05, none presented a pre-planned alternative hypothesis, and none calculated statistical power and the probability of &lsquo;false negatives&rsquo; (beta error). The papers reported 49 significance tests on average. Of 41 papers that contained verbal descriptions of a &lsquo;statistically non-significant&rsquo; result, 26 (63%) falsely claimed the absence of an effect. We conclude that our studies in ecology and evolutionary biology are mostly exploratory and descriptive. We should thus shift from claiming to &ldquo;test&rdquo; specific hypotheses statistically to describing and discussing many hypotheses (effect sizes) that are most compatible with our data, given our statistical model. We already have the means for doing so, because we routinely present compatibility (&ldquo;confidence&rdquo;) intervals covering these hypotheses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Berner","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Amrhein","given":"Valentin"}],"citation-key":"berneramrhein_WhyHowWe_2021","DOI":"10.20944/preprints202112.0235.v1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,14]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Preprints","source":"www.preprints.org","title":"Why and How We Should Join the Shift From Significance Testing to Estimation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202112.0235/v1"},
  {"id":"bhavnanietal_AcceptabilityFeasibilityUtility_2022","abstract":"Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive means to advancing our understanding of the development and function of the brain. However, the majority of the world’s population residing in low and middle income countries has historically been limited from contributing to, and thereby benefiting from, such neurophysiological research, due to lack of scalable validated methods of EEG data collection. In this study, we establish a standard operating protocol to collect approximately 3 min each of eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state EEG data using a low-cost portable EEG device in rural households through formative work in the community. We then evaluate the acceptability of these EEG assessments to young children and feasibility of administering them through non-specialist workers. Finally, we describe properties of the EEG recordings obtained using this novel approach to EEG data collection. The formative phase was conducted with 9 families which informed protocols for consenting, child engagement strategies and data collection. The protocol was then implemented on 1265 families. 977 children (Mean age = 38.8 months, SD = 0.9) and 1199 adults (Mean age = 27.0 years, SD = 4) provided resting-state data for this study. 259 children refused to wear the EEG cap or removed it, and 58 children refused the eyes-closed recording session. Hardware or software issues were experienced during 30 and 25 recordings in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions respectively. Disturbances during the recording sessions were rare and included participants moving their heads, touching the EEG headset with their hands, opening their eyes within the eyes-closed recording session, and presence of loud sounds in the testing environment. Similar to findings in laboratory-based studies from high-income settings, the percentage of recordings which showed an alpha peak was higher in eyes-closed than eyes-open condition, with the peak occurring most frequently in electrodes at O1 and O2 positions, and the mean frequency of the alpha peak was found to be lower in children (8.43 Hz, SD = 1.73) as compared to adults (10.71 Hz, SD = 3.96). We observed a deterioration in the EEG signal with prolonged device usage. This study demonstrates the acceptability, feasibility and utility of conducting EEG research at scale in a rural low-resource community, while highlighting its potential limitations, and offers the impetus needed to further refine the methods and devices and validate such scalable methods to overcome existing research inequity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhavnani","given":"Supriya"},{"family":"Parameshwaran","given":"Dhanya"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Kamal Kant"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Debarati"},{"family":"Divan","given":"Gauri"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Vikram"},{"family":"Thiagarajan","given":"Tara C."}],"citation-key":"bhavnanietal_AcceptabilityFeasibilityUtility_2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

Diverging analysis approaches have segregated the community into research silos, limiting the replication and clinical translation of findings. A primary source of this fractionation is the diversity of approaches used to reduce complex brain data into a lower-dimensional set of features for analysis and interpretation, which we refer to as brain representations.

  {"id":"bijsterboschetal_RelationshipSpatialConfiguration_2018","abstract":"Brain connectivity is often considered in terms of the communication between functionally distinct brain regions. Many studies have investigated the extent to which patterns of coupling strength between multiple neural populations relates to behaviour. For example, studies have used ‘functional connectivity fingerprints’ to characterise individuals' brain activity. Here, we investigate the extent to which the exact spatial arrangement of cortical regions interacts with measures of brain connectivity. We find that the shape and exact location of brain regions interact strongly with the modelling of brain connectivity, and present evidence that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behaviour and lifestyle. We believe that, in many cases, cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions are being interpreted as changes in functional connectivity. Therefore, a better understanding of these effects is important when interpreting the relationship between functional imaging data and cognitive traits.\n          , \n            People differ a lot from one another in terms of their personality, behaviour and lifestyle. This individuality is attributed to the different regions in the brain, and the strength of communication between them. The connectivity pattern between these areas is thought to be as unique as a fingerprint. If the connections are weak or disrupted it can play a role in conditions such as schizophrenia, depression or Alzheimer’s disease. It is thought that the strength of the connection depends on how strongly the nerve cells in these regions communicate. But are these individual differences solely caused by different strengths of connection, or could other factors contribute to them?\n            Now, Bijsterbosch et al. found that the size, shape and exact position of the brain regions was also strongly linked to the different behaviours of individuals. The study used brain scans, behavioural tests and questionnaires from a large database about lifestyle choices and demographics, to analyse the relationship between the different brain features of healthy individuals. The results showed that the variations in the brain regions were linked to many behavioural factors including intelligence, life satisfaction, drug use and aggression problems. Moreover, Bijsterbosch et al. showed that the existing methods for estimating the strength of connection between brain regions could reveal more about the spatial layout of these regions than the actual connection strength between them. This suggests that new approaches are needed to properly evaluate the strength of the connections.\n            Some psychiatric and neurological diseases may be associated with changes in size and position of the different regions in the brain. In future, the findings of this study could be applied to individuals affected by such conditions, to see if the location of a region could be used as a diagnostic indicator.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bijsterbosch","given":"Janine Diane"},{"family":"Woolrich","given":"Mark W"},{"family":"Glasser","given":"Matthew F"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Emma C"},{"family":"Beckmann","given":"Christian F"},{"family":"Van Essen","given":"David C"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Samuel J"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Stephen M"}],"citation-key":"bijsterboschetal_RelationshipSpatialConfiguration_2018","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.32992","ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,16]]},"language":"en","page":"e32992","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The relationship between spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/32992","volume":"7"},

However, the response function that best models breath-holding-induced signal changes, as well as those resulting from a wider range of breathing variations including those occurring during rest, has not yet been determined. Respiration related signal changes appear to be slower than neuronally induced BOLD signal changes and are not modeled accurately using the typical hemodynamic response functions used in fMRI. In this study, we derive a new response function to model the average MRI signal changes induced by variations in the respiration volume (breath-to-breath changes in the respiration depth and rate). This was done by averaging the response to a series of single deep breaths performed once every 40 s amongst otherwise constant breathing. The new \"respiration response function\" consists of an early overshoot followed by a later undershoot (peaking at approximately 16 s), and accurately models the MRI signal changes resulting from breath-holding as well as cued depth and rate changes.","author":[{"family":"Birn","given":"Rasmus M."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Monica A."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Tyler B."},{"family":"Bandettini","given":"Peter A."}],"citation-key":"birnetal_RespirationResponseFunction_2008","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.11.059","ISSN":"1053-8119","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",4,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"644-654","PMCID":"PMC2533266","PMID":"18234517","source":"PubMed","title":"The respiration response function: the temporal dynamics of fMRI signal fluctuations related to changes in respiration","title-short":"The respiration response function","type":"article-journal","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"bittaetal_BurdenNeurodevelopmentalDisorders_2017","abstract":"Background: Childhood mortality from infectious diseases has declined steadily in many low and middle-income (LAMIC) countries, with increased recognition of non-communicable diseases such as neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). There is lack of data on the burden of NDD in LAMIC. Current global burden of these disorders are largely extrapolated from high-income countries. The main objective of the study was therefore to estimate the burden of NDD in LAMIC using meta-analytic techniques. Methods: We systematically searched online databases including Medline/PubMed, PsychoInfo, and Embase for studies that reported prevalence or incidence of NDD. Pooled prevalence, heterogeneity and risk factors for prevalence were determined using meta-analytic techniques.   Results: We identified 4,802 records, but only 51 studies met the eligibility criteria. Most studies were from Asia (52.2%) and most were on neurological disorders (63.1%). The median pooled prevalence per 1,000 for all NDD was 7.6 (95%CI 7.5-7.7), being 11.3 (11.7-12.0) for neurological disorders and 3.2 (95%CI 3.1-3.3) for mental conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The type of NDD was significantly associated with the greatest prevalence ratio in the multivariable model (PR=2.6(95%CI 0.6-11.6) (P>0.05). Incidence was only reported for epilepsy (mean of 447.7 (95%CI 415.3-481.9) per 100,000). Perinatal complications were the commonest risk factor for NDD.

  {"id":"bragaetal_ParallelDistributedNetworks_2019","abstract":"Examination of large-scale distributed networks within the individual reveals details of cortical network organization that are absent in group-averaged studies. One recent discovery is that a distributed transmodal network, often referred to as the “default network,” comprises two closely interdigitated networks, only one of which is coupled to posterior parahippocampal cortex. Not all studies of individuals have identified the same networks, and questions remain about the degree to which the two networks are separate, particularly within regions hypothesized to be interconnected hubs. In this study we replicate the observation of network separation across analytical (seed-based connectivity and parcellation) and data projection (volume and surface) methods in two individuals each scanned 31 times. Additionally, three individuals were examined with high-resolution (7T; 1.35 mm) functional magnetic resonance imaging to gain further insight into the anatomical details. The two networks were identified with separate regions localized to adjacent portions of the cortical ribbon, sometimes inside the same sulcus. Midline regions previously implicated as hubs revealed near complete spatial separation of the two networks, displaying a complex spatial topography in the posterior cingulate and precuneus. The network coupled to parahippocampal cortex also revealed a separate region directly within the hippocampus, at or near the subiculum. These collective results support that the default network is composed of at least two spatially juxtaposed networks. Fine spatial details and juxtapositions of the two networks can be identified within individuals at high resolution, providing insight into the network organization of association cortex and placing further constraints on interpretation of group-averaged neuroimaging data.\n            NEW & NOTEWORTHY Recent evidence has emerged that canonical large-scale networks such as the “default network” fractionate into parallel distributed networks when defined within individuals. This research uses high-resolution imaging to show that the networks possess juxtapositions sometimes evident inside the same sulcus and within regions that have been previously hypothesized to be network hubs. Distinct circumscribed regions of one network were also resolved in the hippocampal formation, at or near the parahippocampal cortex and subiculum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Braga","given":"Rodrigo M."},{"family":"Van Dijk","given":"Koene R.

  {"id":"brodbecketal_ElectroencephalographicSourceImaging_2011","abstract":"Electroencephalography is mandatory to determine the epilepsy syndrome. However, for the precise localization of the irritative zone in patients with focal epilepsy, costly and sometimes cumbersome imaging techniques are used. Recent small studies using electric source imaging suggest that electroencephalography itself could be used to localize the focus. However, a large prospective validation study is missing. This study presents a cohort of 152 operated patients where electric source imaging was applied as part of the pre-surgical work-up allowing a comparison with the results from other methods. Patients (n = 152) with &gt;1 year postoperative follow-up were studied prospectively. The sensitivity and specificity of each imaging method was defined by comparing the localization of the source maximum with the resected zone and surgical outcome. Electric source imaging had a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 88% if the electroencephalogram was recorded with a large number of electrodes (128–256 channels) and the individual magnetic resonance image was used as head model. These values compared favourably with those of structural magnetic resonance imaging (76% sensitivity, 53% specificity), positron emission tomography (69% sensitivity, 44% specificity) and ictal/interictal single-photon emission-computed tomography (58% sensitivity, 47% specificity). The sensitivity and specificity of electric source imaging decreased to 57% and 59%, respectively, with low number of electrodes (&lt;32 channels) and a template head model. This study demonstrated the validity and clinical utility of electric source imaging in a large prospective study. Given the low cost and high flexibility of electroencephalographic systems even with high channel counts, we conclude that electric source imaging is a highly valuable tool in pre-surgical epilepsy evaluation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Brodbeck","given":"Verena"},{"family":"Spinelli","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Lascano","given":"Agustina M."},{"family":"Wissmeier","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Vargas","given":"Maria-Isabel"},{"family":"Vulliemoz","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Pollo","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Schaller","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Michel","given":"Christoph M."},{"family":"Seeck","given":"Margitta"}],"citation-key":"brodbecketal_ElectroencephalographicSourceImaging_2011","container-title":"Brain","container-title-short":"Brain","DOI":"10.1093/brain/awr243","ISSN":"0006-8950","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",10,1]]},"page":"2887-2897","source":"Silverchair","title":"Electroencephalographic source imaging: a prospective study of 152 operated epileptic patients","title-short":"Electroencephalographic source imaging","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awr243","volume":"134"},
  {"id":"brookesetal_MeasuringFunctionalConnectivity_2011","abstract":"Functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions is thought to be central to the way in which the brain processes information. Abnormal connectivity is thought to be implicated in a number of diseases. The ability to study FC is therefore a key goal for neuroimaging. Functional connectivity (fc) MRI has become a popular tool to make connectivity measurements but the technique is limited by its indirect nature. A multimodal approach is therefore an attractive means to investigate the electrodynamic mechanisms underlying hemodynamic connectivity. In this paper, we investigate resting state FC using fcMRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG). In fcMRI, we exploit the advantages afforded by ultra high magnetic field. In MEG we apply envelope correlation and coherence techniques to source space projected MEG signals. We show that beamforming provides an excellent means to measure FC in source space using MEG data. However, care must be taken when interpreting these measurements since cross talk between voxels in source space can potentially lead to spurious connectivity and this must be taken into account in all studies of this type. We show good spatial agreement between FC measured independently using MEG and fcMRI; FC between sensorimotor cortices was observed using both modalities, with the best spatial agreement when MEG data are filtered into the β band. This finding helps to reduce the potential confounds associated with each modality alone: while it helps reduce the uncertainties in spatial patterns generated by MEG (brought about by the ill posed inverse problem), addition of electrodynamic metric confirms the neural basis of fcMRI measurements. Finally, we show that multiple MEG based FC metrics allow the potential to move beyond what is possible using fcMRI, and investigate the nature of electrodynamic connectivity. Our results extend those from previous studies and add weight to the argument that neural oscillations are intimately related to functional connectivity and the BOLD response.","author":[{"family":"Brookes","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Hale","given":"Joanne R."},{"family":"Zumer","given":"Johanna M."},{"family":"Stevenson","given":"Claire M."},{"family":"Francis","given":"Susan T."},{"family":"Barnes","given":"Gareth R."},{"family":"Owen","given":"Julia P."},{"family":"Morris","given":"Peter G."},{"family":"Nagarajan","given":"Srikantan S."}],"citation-key":"brookesetal_MeasuringFunctionalConnectivity_2011","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.054","ISSN":"1095-9572","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"1082-1104","PMCID":"PMC3224862","PMID":"21352925","source":"PubMed","title":"Measuring functional connectivity using MEG: methodology and comparison with fcMRI","title-short":"Measuring functional connectivity using MEG","type":"article-journal","volume":"56"},

While Current Source Density (CSD) estimates, through the Surface Laplacian (SL) computation, are well known to dramatically reduce volume conduction effects and hence improve EEG spatial resolution, its positive impact on EEG temporal resolution is much less recognized.

Here we review the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations and outline empirical questions and controversial conceptual issues. Our main points are as follows: First, gamma-band rhythmogenesis is inextricably tied to perisomatic inhibition. Second, gamma oscillations are short-lived and typically emerge from the coordinated interaction of excitation and inhibition, which can be detected as local field potentials. Third, gamma rhythm typically concurs with irregular firing of single neurons, and the network frequency of gamma oscillations varies extensively depending on the underlying mechanism. To document gamma oscillations, efforts should be made to distinguish them from mere increases of gamma-band power and/or increased spiking activity. Fourth, the magnitude of gamma oscillation is modulated by slower rhythms. Such cross-frequency coupling may serve to couple active patches of cortical circuits. Because of their ubiquitous nature and strong correlation with the “operational modes” of local circuits, gamma oscillations continue to provide important clues about neuronal population dynamics in health and disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Buzsáki","given":"György"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiao-Jing"}],"citation-key":"buzsakiwang_MechanismsGammaOscillations_2012","container-title":"Annual Review of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Annu.

However, ESI accuracy strongly depends on the forward model capabilities to accurately describe the subject’s head anatomy from the available structural data. Attempting to improve the ESI performance, we enhance the brain structure model within the individual-defined forward problem formulation, combining the head geometry complexity of the modeled tissue compartments and the prior knowledge of the brain tissue morphology. We validate the proposed methodology using 25 subjects, from which a set of magnetic-resonance imaging scans is acquired, extracting the anatomical priors and an electroencephalography signal set needed for validating the ESI scenarios. Obtained results confirm that incorporating patient-specific head models enhances the performed accuracy and improves the localization of focal and deep sources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Céspedes-Villar","given":"Yohan"},{"family":"Martinez-Vargas","given":"Juan David"},{"family":"Castellanos-Dominguez","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"cespedes-villaretal_InfluencePatientSpecificHead_2020","container-title":"Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine","container-title-short":"Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine","DOI":"10.1155/2020/5076865","ISSN":"1748-670X, 1748-6718","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"1-15","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Influence of Patient-Specific Head Modeling on EEG Source Imaging","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2020/5076865/","volume":"2020"},
  {"id":"changglover_RelationshipRespirationEndtidal_2009","abstract":"A significant component of BOLD fMRI physiological noise is caused by variations in the depth and rate of respiration. It has previously been demonstrated that a breath-to-breath metric of respiratory variation (respiratory volume per time; RVT), computed from pneumatic belt measurements of chest expansion, has a strong linear relationship with resting-state BOLD signals across the brain. RVT is believed to capture breathing-induced changes in arterial CO(2), which is a cerebral vasodilator; indeed, separate studies have found that spontaneous fluctuations in end-tidal CO(2) (PETCO(2)) are correlated with BOLD signal time series. The present study quantifies the degree to which RVT and PETCO(2) measurements relate to one another and explain common aspects of the resting-state BOLD signal. It is found that RVT (particularly when convolved with a particular impulse response, the \"respiration response function\") is highly correlated with PETCO(2), and that both explain remarkably similar spatial and temporal BOLD signal variance across the brain. In addition, end-tidal O(2) is shown to be largely redundant with PETCO(2). Finally, the latency at which PETCO(2) and respiration belt measures are correlated with the time series of individual voxels is found to vary across the brain and may reveal properties of intrinsic vascular response delays.","author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"Catie"},{"family":"Glover","given":"Gary H."}],"citation-key":"changglover_RelationshipRespirationEndtidal_2009","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.04.048","ISSN":"1095-9572","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",10,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"1381-1393","PMCID":"PMC2721281","PMID":"19393322","source":"PubMed","title":"Relationship between respiration, end-tidal CO2, and BOLD signals in resting-state fMRI","type":"article-journal","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"cnuddeetal_IncreasedNeuralEfficiency_2021","abstract":"Visual word recognition is a relatively effortless process, but recent research suggests the system involved is malleable, with evidence of increases in behavioural efficiency after prolonged lexical decision task (LDT) performance. However, the extent of neural changes has yet to be characterized in this context. The neural changes that occur could be related to a shift from initially effortful performance that is supported by control-related processing, to efficient task performance that is supported by domain-specific processing. To investigate this, we replicated the British Lexicon Project, and had participants complete 16 h of LDT over several days. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) at three intervals to track neural change during LDT performance and assessed event-related potentials and brain signal complexity. We found that response times decreased during LDT performance, and there was evidence of neural change through N170, P200, N400, and late positive component (LPC) amplitudes across the EEG sessions, which suggested a shift from control-related to domain-specific processing. We also found widespread complexity decreases alongside localized increases, suggesting that processing became more efficient with specific increases in processing flexibility. Together, these findings suggest that neural processing becomes more efficient and optimized to support prolonged LDT performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Cnudde","given":"Kelsey"},{"family":"Hees","given":"Sophia","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Sage"},{"family":"Wijk","given":"Gwen","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Pexman","given":"Penny M."},{"family":"Protzner","given":"Andrea B."}],"citation-key":"cnuddeetal_IncreasedNeuralEfficiency_2021","container-title":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e23030304","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"3","page":"304","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Increased Neural Efficiency in Visual Word Recognition: Evidence from Alterations in Event-Related Potentials and Multiscale Entropy","title-short":"Increased Neural Efficiency in Visual Word Recognition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/3/304","volume":"23"},

These networks of spontaneous activity correlation or resting state networks (RSN) are closely related to the underlying anatomical connectivity, but their topography is also gated by the history of prior task activation. Network coherence does not depend on covert cognitive activity, but its strength and integrity relates to behavioral performance. Some RSN are functionally organized as dynamically competing systems both at rest and during tasks. Computational studies show that one of such dynamics, the anticorrelation between networks, depends on noise-driven transitions between different multistable cluster synchronization states. These multistable states emerge because of transmission delays between regions that are modeled as coupled oscillators systems. Large-scale systems dynamics are useful for keeping different functional subnetworks in a state of heightened competition, which can be stabilized and fired by even small modulations of either sensory or internal signals.","author":[{"family":"Deco","given":"Gustavo"},{"family":"Corbetta","given":"Maurizio"}],"citation-key":"decocorbetta_DynamicalBalanceBrain_2011","container-title":"The Neuroscientist: A Review Journal Bringing Neurobiology, Neurology and Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Neuroscientist","DOI":"10.1177/1073858409354384","ISSN":"1089-4098","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",2]]},"language":"eng","page":"107-123","PMCID":"PMC4139497","PMID":"21196530","source":"PubMed","title":"The dynamical balance of the brain at rest","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"dinicolaetal_ParallelDistributedNetworks_2020","abstract":"Association cortex is organized into large-scale distributed networks. One such network, the default network (DN), is linked to diverse forms of internal mentation, opening debate about whether shared or distinct anatomy supports multiple forms of cognition. Using within-individual analysis procedures that preserve idiosyncratic anatomical details, we probed whether multiple tasks from two domains, episodic projection and theory of mind (ToM), rely on the same or distinct networks. In an initial experiment (6 subjects, each scanned 4 times), we found evidence that episodic projection and ToM tasks activate separate regions distributed throughout the cortex, with adjacent regions in parietal, temporal, prefrontal, and midline zones. These distinctions were predicted by the hypothesis that the DN comprises two parallel, interdigitated networks. One network, linked to parahippocampal cortex (PHC), is preferentially recruited during episodic projection, including both remembering and imagining the future. A second juxtaposed network, which includes the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), is differentially engaged during multiple forms of ToM. In two prospectively acquired independent experiments, we replicated and triplicated the dissociation (each with 6 subjects scanned 4 times). Furthermore, the dissociation was found in all zones when analyzed independently, including robustly in midline regions previously described as hubs. The TPJ-linked network is interwoven with the PHC-linked network across the cortex, making clear why it is difficult to fully resolve the two networks in group-averaged or lower-resolution data. These results refine our understanding of the functional-anatomical organization of association cortex and raise fundamental questions about how specialization might arise in parallel, juxtaposed association networks.\n            NEW & NOTEWORTHY Two distributed, interdigitated networks exist within the bounds of the canonical default network. Here we used repeated scanning of individuals, across three independent samples, to provide evidence that tasks requiring episodic projection or theory of mind differentially recruit the two networks across multiple cortical zones. The two distributed networks thus appear to preferentially subserve distinct functions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"DiNicola","given":"Lauren M."},{"family":"Braga","given":"Rodrigo M."},{"family":"Buckner","given":"Randy L."}],"citation-key":"dinicolaetal_ParallelDistributedNetworks_2020","container-title":"Journal of Neurophysiology","container-title-short":"Journal of Neurophysiology","DOI":"10.1152/jn.00529.2019","ISSN":"0022-3077, 1522-1598","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1144-1179","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Parallel distributed networks dissociate episodic and social functions within the individual","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/jn.00529.2019","volume":"123"},
  {"id":"doumaweedon_AnalysingContinuousProportions_2019","abstract":"Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation.\n\nIn this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions.\n\nA major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of >2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression.\n\nBeta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Douma","given":"Jacob C."},{"family":"Weedon","given":"James T."}],"citation-key":"doumaweedon_AnalysingContinuousProportions_2019","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Methods Ecol Evol","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13234","editor":[{"family":"Warton","given":"David"}],"ISSN":"2041-210X, 2041-210X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9]]},"language":"en","note":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3234670","page":"1412-1430","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Analysing continuous proportions in ecology and evolution: A practical introduction to beta and Dirichlet regression","title-short":"Analysing continuous proportions in ecology and evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13234","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"dworetskyetal_ProbabilisticMappingHuman_2021","abstract":"Many recent developments surrounding the functional network organization of the human brain have focused on data that have been averaged across groups of individuals. While such group-level approaches have shed considerable light on the brain's large-scale distributed systems, they conceal individual differences in network organization, which recent work has demonstrated to be common and widespread. This individual variability produces noise in group analyses, which may average together regions that are part of different functional systems across participants, limiting interpretability. However, cost and feasibility constraints may limit the possibility for individual-level mapping within studies. Here our goal was to leverage information about individual-level brain organization to probabilistically map common functional systems and identify locations of high inter-subject consensus for use in group analyses. We probabilistically mapped 14 functional networks in multiple datasets with relatively high amounts of data. All networks show \"core\" (high-probability) regions, but differ from one another in the extent of their higher-variability components. These patterns replicate well across four datasets with different participants and scanning parameters. We produced a set of high-probability regions of interest (ROIs) from these probabilistic maps; these and the probabilistic maps are made publicly available, together with a tool for querying the network membership probabilities associated with any given cortical location. These quantitative estimates and public tools may allow researchers to apply information about inter-subject consensus to their own fMRI studies, improving inferences about systems and their functional specializations.","author":[{"family":"Dworetsky","given":"Ally"},{"family":"Seitzman","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Adeyemo","given":"Babatunde"},{"family":"Neta","given":"Maital"},{"family":"Coalson","given":"Rebecca S."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Steven E."},{"family":"Gratton","given":"Caterina"}],"citation-key":"dworetskyetal_ProbabilisticMappingHuman_2021","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118164","ISSN":"1095-9572","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"118164","PMCID":"PMC8296467","PMID":"34000397","source":"PubMed","title":"Probabilistic mapping of human functional brain networks identifies regions of high group consensus","type":"article-journal","volume":"237"},

In just over 6 years, the WU-Minn-Ox consortium succeeded in its core objectives by: 1) improving MR scanner hardware, pulse sequence design, and image reconstruction methods, 2) acquiring and analyzing multimodal MRI and MEG data of unprecedented quality together with behavioral measures from more than 1100 HCP participants, and 3) freely sharing the data (via the ConnectomeDB database) and associated analysis and visualization tools.

The \"HCP-style\" neuroimaging paradigm has emerged as a set of best-practice strategies for optimizing data acquisition and analysis. This article reviews the history of the HCP, including comments on key events and decisions associated with major project components. We discuss several scientific advances using HCP data, including improved cortical parcellations, analyses of connectivity based on functional and diffusion MRI, and analyses of brain-behavior relationships.

However, due to practical limitations, many studies do not collect enough resting-state data to generate reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity necessary for studying individual differences. Here we present general functional connectivity (GFC) as a method for leveraging shared features across resting-state and task fMRI and demonstrate in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Study that GFC offers better test-retest reliability than intrinsic connectivity estimated from the same amount of resting-state data alone. Furthermore, at equivalent scan lengths, GFC displayed higher estimates of heritability than resting-state functional connectivity. We also found that predictions of cognitive ability from GFC generalized across datasets, performing as well or better than resting-state or task data alone. Collectively, our work suggests that GFC can improve the reliability of intrinsic connectivity estimates in existing datasets and, subsequently, the opportunity to identify meaningful correlates of individual differences in behavior. Given that task and resting-state data are often collected together, many researchers can immediately derive more reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity through the adoption of GFC rather than solely using resting-state data. Moreover, by better capturing heritable variation in intrinsic connectivity, GFC represents a novel endophenotype with broad applications in clinical neuroscience and biomarker discovery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Elliott","given":"Maxwell L."},{"family":"Knodt","given":"Annchen R."},{"family":"Cooke","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Kim","given":"M.

  {"id":"falketal_WhatRepresentativeBrain_2013","abstract":"The last decades of neuroscience research have produced immense progress in the methods available to understand brain structure and function. Social, cognitive, clinical, affective, economic, communication, and developmental neurosciences have begun to map the relationships between neuro-psychological processes and behavioral outcomes, yielding a new understanding of human behavior and promising interventions. However, a limitation of this fast moving research is that most findings are based on small samples of convenience. Furthermore, our understanding of individual differences may be distorted by unrepresentative samples, undermining findings regarding brain–behavior mechanisms. These limitations are issues that social demographers, epidemiologists, and other population scientists have tackled, with solutions that can be applied to neuroscience. By contrast, nearly all social science disciplines, including social demography, sociology, political science, economics, communication science, and psychology, make assumptions about processes that involve the brain, but have incorporated neural measures to differing, and often limited, degrees; many still treat the brain as a black box.

  {"id":"fedorenko_EarlyOriginsGrowing_2021","abstract":"In the last three decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has transformed the field of cognitive neuroscience. A standard analytic approach entails aligning a set of individual activation maps in a common brain space, performing a statistical test in each voxel, and interpreting significant activation clusters with respect to macroanatomic landmarks. In the last several years, however, this group-analytic approach is being increasingly replaced by analyses where neural responses are examined within each brain individually. In this opinion piece, I trace the origins of individual-subject analyses in human neuroscience and speculate on why group analyses had risen vastly in popularity during the 2000s. I then discuss a core problem with group analyses — their limited utility in informing the human cognitive architecture — and talk about how the individual-subject functional localization approach solves this problem. Finally, I discuss other reasons for why researchers have been turning to individual-subject analyses, and argue that such approaches are likely to be the future of human neuroscience.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Fedorenko","given":"Evelina"}],"citation-key":"fedorenko_EarlyOriginsGrowing_2021","collection-title":"Deep Imaging - Personalized Neuroscience","container-title":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.cobeha.2021.02.023","ISSN":"2352-1546","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"105-112","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The early origins and the growing popularity of the individual-subject analytic approach in human neuroscience","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154621000462","volume":"40"},

Recent work has established that whole-brain functional connectivity patterns are relatively stable within individuals and unique across individuals, and that features of these patterns predict various traits.

Here, we show that compared to the resting state, functional connectivity measured during naturalistic viewing—i.e., movie watching—yields more accurate predictions of trait-like phenotypes in the both cognitive and emotional domains.

Rest has become the default state for probing individual differences, chiefly because it is easy to acquire and a supposed neutral backdrop. However, the assumption that rest is the optimal condition for individual differences research is largely untested. In fact, other brain states may afford a better ratio of within- to between-subject variability, facilitating biomarker discovery. Depending on the trait or behavior under study, certain tasks may bring out meaningful idiosyncrasies across subjects, essentially enhancing the individual signal in networks of interest beyond what can be measured at rest.

Yet relatively little work combines these two, perhaps because traditional analysis approaches for naturalistic imaging data are geared toward detecting shared responses rather than between-subject variability. Here, we review recent work using naturalistic stimuli to study individual differences, and advance a framework for detecting structure in idiosyncratic patterns of brain activity, or “idiosynchrony”.

We identify two diametrically opposed, widely distributed brain networks on the basis of both spontaneous correlations within each network and anticorrelations between networks. One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations. This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which to understand brain function.

The essential idea underlying this generalization is to examine the impact on the precision of estimation—in particular, the size of an ellipsoidal joint confidence region for β 1—of less-than-optimal selection of other columns of the design matrix (X 2), treating still other columns (X 0) as unalterable, even hypothetically. In typical applications, X 1 contains a set of dummy regressors coding categories of a qualitative variable or a set of polynomial regressors in a quantitative variable; X 2 contains all other regressors in the model, save the constant, which is in X 0. If σ 2 V denotes the realized variance of , and σ 2 U is the variance associated with an optimal selection of X 2, then the corresponding scaled dispersion ellipsoids to be compared are ℰ v = x : x′V –1 x ≤ 1 and ℰ U = x : x′U –1 x ≤ 1, where ℰ U is contained in ℰ v . The two ellipsoids can be compared by considering the radii of ℰ v relative to ℰ U , obtained through the spectral decomposition of V relative to U. We proceed to explore the geometry of generalized variance inflation, to show the relationship of these measures to correlation-matrix determinants and canonical correlations, to consider X matrices structured by relations of marginality among regressor subspaces, to develop the relationship of generalized variance inflation to hypothesis tests in the multivariate normal linear model, and to present several examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Fox","given":"John"},{"family":"Monette","given":"Georges"}],"citation-key":"foxmonette_GeneralizedCollinearityDiagnostics_1992","container-title":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","DOI":"10.1080/01621459.1992.10475190","ISSN":"0162-1459","issue":"417","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",3,1]]},"page":"178-183","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Generalized Collinearity Diagnostics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1992.10475190","volume":"87"},

In this context, the present paper aims to investigate the impact of some of the most commonly used metrics to estimate functional connectivity on the ability to unveil personal distinctive patterns of inter-channel interactions. Different metrics were compared in terms of equal error rate. It is widely accepted that each connectivity metric carries specific information in respect to the underlying interactions. Experimental results on publicly available EEG recordings show that different connectivity metrics define peculiar subjective profile of connectivity and show different mechanisms to detect subject-specific patterns of inter-channel interactions. Moreover, these findings highlight that some measures are more accurate and more robust than others, regardless of the task performed by the user.

  {"id":"frostgoebel_MeasuringStructuralFunctional_2012","abstract":"The central question of the relationship between structure and function in the human brain is still not well understood. In order to investigate this fundamental relationship we create functional probabilistic maps from a large set of mapping experiments and compare the location of functionally localised regions across subjects using different whole-brain alignment schemes. To avoid the major problems associated with meta-analysis approaches, all subjects are scanned using the same paradigms, the same scanner and the same analysis pipeline. We show that an advanced, curvature driven cortex based alignment (CBA) scheme largely removes macro-anatomical variability across subjects. Remaining variability in the observed spatial location of functional regions, thus, reflects the “true” functional variability, i.e. the quantified variability is a good estimator of the underlying structural–functional correspondence. After localising 13 widely studied functional areas, we found a large variability in the degree to which functional areas respect macro-anatomical boundaries across the cortex. Some areas, such as the frontal eye fields (FEF) are strongly bound to a macro-anatomical location. Fusiform face area (FFA) on the other hand, varies in its location along the length of the fusiform gyrus even though the gyri themselves are well aligned across subjects. Language areas were found to vary greatly across subjects whilst a high degree of overlap was observed in sensory and motor areas. The observed differences in functional variability for different specialised areas suggest that a more complete estimation of the structure–function relationship across the whole cortex requires further empirical studies with an expanded test battery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Frost","given":"Martin A."},{"family":"Goebel","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"frostgoebel_MeasuringStructuralFunctional_2012","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"NeuroImage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.08.035","ISSN":"1053-8119","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1,16]]},"language":"en","page":"1369-1381","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Measuring structural–functional correspondence: Spatial variability of specialised brain regions after macro-anatomical alignment","title-short":"Measuring structural–functional correspondence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911009281","volume":"59"},

  {"id":"gigerenzer_StatisticalRitualsReplication_2018","abstract":"The “replication crisis” has been attributed to misguided external incentives gamed by researchers (the strategic-game hypothesis). Here, I want to draw attention to a complementary internal factor, namely, researchers’ widespread faith in a statistical ritual and associated delusions (the statistical-ritual hypothesis). The “null ritual,” unknown in statistics proper, eliminates judgment precisely at points where statistical theories demand it. The crucial delusion is that the p value specifies the probability of a successful replication (i.e., 1 – p), which makes replication studies appear to be superfluous. A review of studies with 839 academic psychologists and 991 students shows that the replication delusion existed among 20% of the faculty teaching statistics in psychology, 39% of the professors and lecturers, and 66% of the students. Two further beliefs, the illusion of certainty (e.g., that statistical significance proves that an effect exists) and Bayesian wishful thinking (e.g., that the probability of the alternative hypothesis being true is 1 – p), also make successful replication appear to be certain or almost certain, respectively. In every study reviewed, the majority of researchers (56%–97%) exhibited one or more of these delusions. Psychology departments need to begin teaching statistical thinking, not rituals, and journal editors should no longer accept manuscripts that report results as “significant” or “not significant.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Gigerenzer","given":"Gerd"}],"citation-key":"gigerenzer_StatisticalRitualsReplication_2018","container-title":"Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science","DOI":"10.1177/2515245918771329","ISSN":"2515-2459","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"198-218","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Statistical Rituals: The Replication Delusion and How We Got There","title-short":"Statistical Rituals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245918771329","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"glasseretal_MultimodalParcellationHuman_2016","abstract":"Understanding the amazingly complex human cerebral cortex requires a map (or parcellation) of its major subdivisions, known as cortical areas. Making an accurate areal map has been a century-old objective in neuroscience. Using multi-modal magnetic resonance images from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and an objective semi-automated neuroanatomical approach, we delineated 180 areas per hemisphere bounded by sharp changes in cortical architecture, function, connectivity, and/or topography in a precisely aligned group average of 210 healthy young adults. We characterized 97 new areas and 83 areas previously reported using post-mortem microscopy or other specialized study-specific approaches. To enable automated delineation and identification of these areas in new HCP subjects and in future studies, we trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize the multi-modal 'fingerprint' of each cortical area. This classifier detected the presence of 96.6% of the cortical areas in new subjects, replicated the group parcellation, and could correctly locate areas in individuals with atypical parcellations. The freely available parcellation and classifier will enable substantially improved neuroanatomical precision for studies of the structural and functional organization of human cerebral cortex and its variation across individuals and in development, aging, and disease.","author":[{"family":"Glasser","given":"Matthew F."},{"family":"Coalson","given":"Timothy S."},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Emma C."},{"family":"Hacker","given":"Carl D."},{"family":"Harwell","given":"John"},{"family":"Yacoub","given":"Essa"},{"family":"Ugurbil","given":"Kamil"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Jesper"},{"family":"Beckmann","given":"Christian F."},{"family":"Jenkinson","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Stephen M."},{"family":"Van Essen","given":"David C."}],"citation-key":"glasseretal_MultimodalParcellationHuman_2016","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature18933","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7615","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,11]]},"language":"eng","page":"171-178","PMCID":"PMC4990127","PMID":"27437579","source":"PubMed","title":"A multi-modal parcellation of human cerebral cortex","type":"article-journal","volume":"536"},

  {"id":"gordonetal_DefaultmodeNetworkStreams_2020","abstract":"Significance\n            The human brain is organized into large networks. One important brain network is the Default network, which enables cognitive functions such as social thinking, memory, and reward. In group-averaged data, this network emerges as a unitary whole, despite its involvement in multiple cognitive functions. Here, we tested whether Default networks found in individual humans, rather than group-average networks, contain organized substructure. In individuals, we consistently found nine subnetworks within the Default network. These subnetworks matched brain activity patterns during cognitive tasks. Some subnetworks resembled brain circuits involved in specific Default functions. Others linked Default network to other large networks. In summary, this study describes a set of brain circuits within the Default networks of individual humans.\n          , \n            The human brain is organized into large-scale networks identifiable using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). These functional networks correspond with broad cognitive domains; for example, the Default-mode network (DMN) is engaged during internally oriented cognition. However, functional networks may contain hierarchical substructures corresponding with more specific cognitive functions. Here, we used individual-specific precision RSFC to test whether network substructures could be identified in 10 healthy human brains. Across all subjects and networks, individualized network subdivisions were more valid—more internally homogeneous and better matching spatial patterns of task activation—than canonical networks. These measures of validity were maximized at a hierarchical scale that contained ∼83 subnetworks across the brain. At this scale, nine DMN subnetworks exhibited topographical similarity across subjects, suggesting that this approach identifies homologous neurobiological circuits across individuals. Some DMN subnetworks matched known features of brain organization corresponding with cognitive functions. Other subnetworks represented separate streams by which DMN couples with other canonical large-scale networks, including language and control networks. Together, this work provides a detailed organizational framework for studying the DMN in individual humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Gordon","given":"Evan M."},{"family":"Laumann","given":"Timothy O."},{"family":"Marek","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Raut","given":"Ryan V."},{"family":"Gratton","given":"Caterina"},{"family":"Newbold","given":"Dillan J."},{"family":"Greene","given":"Deanna J."},{"family":"Coalson","given":"Rebecca S."},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Abraham Z."},{"family":"Schlaggar","given":"Bradley L."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Steven E."},{"family":"Dosenbach","given":"Nico U.

These systems are likely to vary spatially across individuals, even after anatomical alignment, but the characteristics of this variance are unknown. Here, we characterized large-scale brain systems across two independent datasets of young adults. In these individuals, we were able to identify brain systems that were similar to those described in the group average, and we observed that individuals had consistent topological arrangement of the system features present in the group average. However, the size of system features varied across individuals in systematic ways, such that expansion of one feature of a given system predicted expansion of other parts of the system. Individual-specific systems also contained unique topological features not present in group average systems; some of these features were consistent across a minority of individuals. These effects were observed even after controlling for data quality and for the accuracy of anatomical registration. The variability characterized here has important implications for cognitive neuroscience investigations, which often assume the functional equivalence of aligned brain regions across individuals.","author":[{"family":"Gordon","given":"Evan M."},{"family":"Laumann","given":"Timothy O."},{"family":"Adeyemo","given":"Babatunde"},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Steven E."}],"citation-key":"gordonetal_IndividualVariabilitySystemLevel_2017","container-title":"Cerebral Cortex (New York, N.Y.: 1991)","container-title-short":"Cereb Cortex","DOI":"10.1093/cercor/bhv239","ISSN":"1460-2199","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"386-399","PMCID":"PMC5939195","PMID":"26464473","source":"PubMed","title":"Individual Variability of the System-Level Organization of the Human Brain","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

There is considerable interest in understanding how brain networks vary across individuals or neuropsychiatric populations or are altered during the performance of speciﬁc behaviors. However, the plausibility and validity of such measurements is dependent on the extent to which functional networks are stable over time or are state dependent. We analyzed data from nine high-quality, highly sampled individuals to parse the magnitude and anatomical distribution of network variability across subjects, sessions, and tasks. Critically, we ﬁnd that functional networks are dominated by common organizational principles and stable individual features, with substantially more modest contributions from task-state and day-to-day variability. Sources of variation were differentially distributed across the brain and differentially linked to intrinsic and task-evoked sources. We conclude that functional networks are suited to measuring stable individual characteristics, suggesting utility in personalized medicine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Gratton","given":"Caterina"},{"family":"Laumann","given":"Timothy O."},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Ashley N."},{"family":"Greene","given":"Deanna J."},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Evan M."},{"family":"Gilmore","given":"Adrian W."},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Steven M."},{"family":"Coalson","given":"Rebecca S."},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Abraham Z."},{"family":"Schlaggar","given":"Bradley L."},{"family":"Dosenbach","given":"Nico U.F."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Steven E."}],"citation-key":"grattonetal_FunctionalBrainNetworks_2018","container-title":"Neuron","container-title-short":"Neuron","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuron.2018.03.035","ISSN":"08966273","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4]]},"language":"en","page":"439-452.e5","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Functional Brain Networks Are Dominated by Stable Group and Individual Factors, Not Cognitive or Daily Variation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896627318302411","volume":"98"},

In two large, independent data sets, we here show that cognitive tasks amplify trait-relevant individual differences in patterns of functional connectivity, such that predictive models built from task fMRI data outperform models built from resting-state fMRI data. Further, certain tasks consistently yield better predictions of fluid intelligence than others, and the task that generates the best-performing models varies by sex. By considering task-induced brain state and sex, the best-performing model explains over 20% of the variance in fluid intelligence scores, as compared to <6% of variance explained by rest-based models. This suggests that identifying and inducing the right brain state in a given group can better reveal brain-behavior relationships, motivating a paradigm shift from rest- to task-based functional connectivity analyses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Greene","given":"Abigail S."},{"family":"Gao","given":"Siyuan"},{"family":"Scheinost","given":"Dustin"},{"family":"Constable","given":"R.

It then discusses several properties of P-values that have been presented as fatal flaws: That P-values exhibit extreme variation across samples (and thus are “unreliable”), confound effect size with sample size, are sensitive to sample size, and depend on investigator sampling intentions. These properties are often criticized from a likelihood or Bayesian framework, yet they are exactly the properties P-values should exhibit when they are constructed and interpreted correctly within their originating framework. Other common criticisms are that P-values force users to focus on irrelevant hypotheses and overstate evidence against those hypotheses. These problems are not however properties of P-values but are faults of researchers who focus on null hypotheses and overstate evidence based on misperceptions that p = 0.05 represents enough evidence to reject hypotheses. Those problems are easily seen without use of Bayesian concepts by translating the observed P-value p into the Shannon information (S-value or surprisal) –log2(p).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Greenland","given":"Sander"}],"citation-key":"greenland_ValidPValuesBehave_2019","container-title":"The American Statistician","container-title-short":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1080/00031305.2018.1529625","ISSN":"0003-1305, 1537-2731","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,29]]},"language":"en","page":"106-114","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Valid P-Values Behave Exactly as They Should: Some Misleading Criticisms of P-Values and Their Resolution With S-Values","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1529625","volume":"73"},
  {"id":"greenlandetal_StatisticalTestsValues_2016","abstract":"Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so—and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Greenland","given":"Sander"},{"family":"Senn","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Rothman","given":"Kenneth J."},{"family":"Carlin","given":"John B."},{"family":"Poole","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Steven N."},{"family":"Altman","given":"Douglas G."}],"citation-key":"greenlandetal_StatisticalTestsValues_2016","container-title":"European Journal of Epidemiology","container-title-short":"Eur J Epidemiol","DOI":"10.1007/s10654-016-0149-3","ISSN":"1573-7284","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"337-350","source":"Springer Link","title":"Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations","title-short":"Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-016-0149-3","volume":"31"},

This finding led to the hypothesis that these regions constitute a network supporting a default mode of brain function. In this study, we investigate three questions pertaining to this hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network exist in the human brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing? How is it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly coupled with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in the default mode network. Next, we examined the functional connectivity of PCC and vACC during a visual processing task and show that the resultant connectivity maps are virtually identical to those obtained during rest. Last, we defined three lateral prefrontal regions showing increased activity during the cognitive task and examined their resting-state connectivity. We report significant inverse correlations among all three lateral prefrontal regions and PCC, suggesting a mechanism for attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive processing. This study constitutes, to our knowledge, the first resting-state connectivity analysis of the default mode and provides the most compelling evidence to date for the existence of a cohesive default mode network. Our findings also provide insight into how this network is modulated by task demands and what functions it might subserve.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Greicius","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Krasnow","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Reiss","given":"Allan L."},{"family":"Menon","given":"Vinod"}],"citation-key":"greiciusetal_FunctionalConnectivityResting_2003","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"greiciusmenon_DefaultModeActivityPassive_2004","abstract":"Abstract\n            Deactivation refers to increased neural activity during low-demand tasks or rest compared with high-demand tasks. Several groups have reported that a particular set of brain regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex, among others, is consistently deactivated. Taken together, these typically deactivated brain regions appear to constitute a default-mode network of brain activity that predominates in the absence of a demanding external task. Examining a passive, block-design sensory task with a standard deactivation analysis (rest epochs vs. stimulus epochs), we demonstrate that the default-mode network is undetectable in one run and only partially detectable in a second run. Using independent component analysis, however, we were able to detect the full default-mode network in both runs and to demonstrate that, in the majority of subjects, it persisted across both rest and stimulus epochs, uncoupled from the task waveform, and so mostly undetectable as deactivation. We also replicate an earlier finding that the default-mode network includes the hippocampus suggesting that episodic memory is incorporated in default-mode cognitive processing. Furthermore, we show that the more a subject's default-mode activity was correlated with the rest epochs (and “deactivated” during stimulus epochs), the greater that subject's activation to the visual and auditory stimuli. We conclude that activity in the default-mode network may persist through both experimental and rest epochs if the experiment is not sufficiently challenging. Time-series analysis of default-mode activity provides a measure of the degree to which a task engages a subject and whether it is sufficient to interrupt the processes—presumably cognitive, internally generated, and involving episodic memory—mediated by the default-mode network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Greicius","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Menon","given":"Vinod"}],"citation-key":"greiciusmenon_DefaultModeActivityPassive_2004","container-title":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1162/0898929042568532","ISSN":"0898-929X, 1530-8898","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1484-1492","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Default-Mode Activity during a Passive Sensory Task: Uncoupled from Deactivation but Impacting Activation","title-short":"Default-Mode Activity during a Passive Sensory Task","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/16/9/1484/3943/Default-Mode-Activity-during-a-Passive-Sensory","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"hackeretal_RestingStateNetwork_2013","abstract":"Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to study brain networks associated with both normal and pathological cognitive functions. The objective of this work is to reliably compute resting state network (RSN) topography in single participants. We trained a supervised classifier (multi-layer perceptron; MLP) to associate blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) correlation maps corresponding to pre-defined seeds with specific RSN identities. Hard classification of maps obtained from a priori seeds was highly reliable across new participants. Interestingly, continuous estimates of RSN membership retained substantial residual error. This result is consistent with the view that RSNs are hierarchically organized, and therefore not fully separable into spatially independent components. After training on a priori seed-based maps, we propagated voxel-wise correlation maps through the MLP to produce estimates of RSN membership throughout the brain. The MLP generated RSN topography estimates in individuals consistent with previous studies, even in brain regions not represented in the training data. This method could be used in future studies to relate RSN topography to other measures of functional brain organization (e.g., task-evoked responses, stimulation mapping, and deficits associated with lesions) in individuals. The multi-layer perceptron was directly compared to two alternative voxel classification procedures, specifically, dual regression and linear discriminant analysis; the perceptron generated more spatially specific RSN maps than either alternative.","author":[{"family":"Hacker","given":"Carl D."},{"family":"Laumann","given":"Timothy O."},{"family":"Szrama","given":"Nicholas P."},{"family":"Baldassarre","given":"Antonello"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Abraham Z."},{"family":"Leuthardt","given":"Eric C."},{"family":"Corbetta","given":"Maurizio"}],"citation-key":"hackeretal_RestingStateNetwork_2013","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.108","ISSN":"1095-9572","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"616-633","PMCID":"PMC3909699","PMID":"23735260","source":"PubMed","title":"Resting state network estimation in individual subjects","type":"article-journal","volume":"82"},

Brain regions within the structural core share high degree, strength, and betweenness centrality, and they constitute connector hubs that link all major structural modules. The structural core contains brain regions that form the posterior components of the human default network. Looking both within and outside of core regions, we observed a substantial correspondence between structural connectivity and resting-state functional connectivity measured in the same participants. The spatial and topological centrality of the core within cortex suggests an important role in functional integration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Hagmann","given":"Patric"},{"family":"Cammoun","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Gigandet","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Meuli","given":"Reto"},{"family":"Honey","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Wedeen","given":"Van J."},{"family":"Sporns","given":"Olaf"}],"citation-key":"hagmannetal_MappingStructuralCore_2008","container-title":"PLOS Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.0060159","ISSN":"1545-7885","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e159","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Mapping the Structural Core of Human Cerebral Cortex","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060159","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"halletal_InterpretingBOLDDialogue_2016","abstract":"Cognitive neuroscience depends on the use of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe brain function. Although commonly used as a surrogate measure of neuronal activity, BOLD signals actually reflect changes in brain blood oxygenation. Understanding the mechanisms linking neuronal activity to vascular perfusion is, therefore, critical in interpreting BOLD. Advances in cellular neuroscience demonstrating differences in this neurovascular relationship in different brain regions, conditions or pathologies are often not accounted for when interpreting BOLD. Meanwhile, within cognitive neuroscience, the increasing use of high magnetic field strengths and the development of model-based tasks and analyses have broadened the capability of BOLD signals to inform us about the underlying neuronal activity, but these methods are less well understood by cellular neuroscientists. In 2016, a Royal Society Theo Murphy Meeting brought scientists from the two communities together to discuss these issues. Here, we consolidate the main conclusions arising from that meeting. We discuss areas of consensus about what BOLD fMRI can tell us about underlying neuronal activity, and how advanced modelling techniques have improved our ability to use and interpret BOLD. We also highlight areas of controversy in understanding BOLD and suggest research directions required to resolve these issues.\n            This article is part of the themed issue ‘Interpreting BOLD: a dialogue between cognitive and cellular neuroscience’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Catherine N."},{"family":"Howarth","given":"Clare"},{"family":"Kurth-Nelson","given":"Zebulun"},{"family":"Mishra","given":"Anusha"}],"citation-key":"halletal_InterpretingBOLDDialogue_2016","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

  {"id":"haufeetal_CriticalAssessmentConnectivity_2013","abstract":"Information flow between brain areas is difficult to estimate from EEG measurements due to the presence of noise as well as due to volume conduction. We here test the ability of popular measures of effective connectivity to detect an underlying neuronal interaction from simulated EEG data, as well as the ability of commonly used inverse source reconstruction techniques to improve the connectivity estimation. We find that volume conduction severely limits the neurophysiological interpretability of sensor-space connectivity analyses. Moreover, it may generally lead to conflicting results depending on the connectivity measure and statistical testing approach used. In particular, we note that the application of Granger-causal (GC) measures combined with standard significance testing leads to the detection of spurious connectivity regardless of whether the analysis is performed on sensor-space data or on sources estimated using three different established inverse methods. This empirical result follows from the definition of GC. The phase-slope index (PSI) does not suffer from this theoretical limitation and therefore performs well on our simulated data. We develop a theoretical framework to characterize artifacts of volume conduction, which may still be present even in reconstructed source time series as zero-lag correlations, and to distinguish their time-delayed brain interaction. Based on this theory we derive a procedure which suppresses the influence of volume conduction, but preserves effects related to time-lagged brain interaction in connectivity estimates. This is achieved by using time-reversed data as surrogates for statistical testing. We demonstrate that this robustification makes Granger-causal connectivity measures applicable to EEG data, achieving similar results as PSI. Integrating the insights of our study, we provide a guidance for measuring brain interaction from EEG data. Software for generating benchmark data is made available.","author":[{"family":"Haufe","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Nikulin","given":"Vadim V."},{"family":"Müller","given":"Klaus-Robert"},{"family":"Nolte","given":"Guido"}],"citation-key":"haufeetal_CriticalAssessmentConnectivity_2013","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.09.036","ISSN":"1095-9572","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"120-133","PMID":"23006806","source":"PubMed","title":"A critical assessment of connectivity measures for EEG data: a simulation study","title-short":"A critical assessment of connectivity measures for EEG data","type":"article-journal","volume":"64"},

Researchers – often implicitly – assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these “standard subjects” are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species – frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior – hence, there are no obvious\n              a priori\n              grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of\n              human\n              nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Henrich","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Heine","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Norenzayan","given":"Ara"}],"citation-key":"henrichetal_WeirdestPeopleWorld_2010","container-title":"Behavioral and Brain Sciences","container-title-short":"Behav Brain Sci","DOI":"10.1017/S0140525X0999152X","ISSN":"0140-525X, 1469-1825","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6]]},"language":"en","page":"61-83","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The weirdest people in the world?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0140525X0999152X/type/journal_article","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"henson_WhatCanFunctional_2005","abstract":"I argue here that functional neuroimaging data--which I restrict to the haemodynamic techniques of fMRI and PET--can inform psychological theorizing, provided one assumes a \"systematic\" function-structure mapping in the brain. In this case, imaging data simply comprise another dependent variable, along with behavioural data, that can be used to test competing theories. In particular, I distinguish two types of inference: function-to-structure deduction and structure-to-function induction. With the former inference, a qualitatively different pattern of activity over the brain under two experimental conditions implies at least one different function associated with changes in the independent variable. With the second type of inference, activity of the same brain region(s) under two conditions implies a common function, possibly not predicted a priori. I illustrate these inferences with imaging studies of recognition memory, short-term memory, and repetition priming. I then consider in greater detail what is meant by a \"systematic\" function-structure mapping and argue that, particularly for structure-to-function induction, this entails a one-to-one mapping between functional and structural units, although the structural unit may be a network of interacting regions and care must be taken over the appropriate level of functional/structural abstraction. Nonetheless, the assumption of a systematic function-structure mapping is a \"working hypothesis\" that, in common with other scientific fields, cannot be proved on independent grounds and is probably best evaluated by the success of the enterprise as a whole. I also consider statistical issues such as the definition of a qualitative difference and methodological issues such as the relationship between imaging and behavioural data. I finish by reviewing various objections to neuroimaging, including neophrenology, functionalism, and equipotentiality, and by observing some criticisms of current practice in the imaging literature.","author":[{"family":"Henson","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"henson_WhatCanFunctional_2005","container-title":"The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology.

The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, detected in fMRI, reflects changes in deoxyhemoglobin driven by localized changes in brain blood flow and blood oxygenation, which are coupled to underlying neuronal activity by a process termed neurovascular coupling. Over the past 10 years, a range of cellular mechanisms, including astrocytes, pericytes, and interneurons, have been proposed to play a role in functional neurovascular coupling. However, the field remains conflicted over the relative importance of each process, while key spatiotemporal features of BOLD response remain unexplained. Here, we review current candidate neurovascular coupling mechanisms and propose that previously overlooked involvement of the vascular endothelium may provide a more complete picture of how blood flow is controlled in the brain. We also explore the possibility and consequences of conditions in which neurovascular coupling may be altered, including during postnatal development, pathological states, and aging, noting relevance to both stimulus-evoked and resting-state fMRI studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Hillman","given":"Elizabeth M.C."}],"citation-key":"hillman_CouplingMechanismSignificance_2014","container-title":"Annual Review of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Annu.

However, what do these power correlation networks reflect? We address this long-outstanding question in neuroscience using rigorous mathematical analysis, biophysical simulations with ground truth and application of these mathematical concepts to empirical magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Our mathematical derivations show that for two non-Gaussian electrophysiological signals, their power correlation depends on their coherence, cokurtosis and conjugate-coherence. Only coherence and cokurtosis contribute to power correlation networks in MEG data, but cokurtosis is less affected by artefactual signal leakage and better mirrors haemodynamic resting-state networks. Simulations and MEG data show that cokurtosis may reflect co-occurrent bursting events. Our findings shed light on the origin of the complementary nature of power correlation networks to phase coupling networks and suggests that the origin of resting-state networks is partly reflected in co-occurent bursts in neuronal activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Hindriks","given":"Rikkert"},{"family":"Tewarie","given":"Prejaas K.

Here we use a computational approach in an attempt to relate these features of spontaneous cortical dynamics to the underlying anatomical connectivity. Simulating nonlinear neuronal dynamics on a network that captures the large-scale interregional connections of macaque neocortex, and applying information theoretic measures to identify functional networks, we find structure–function relations at multiple temporal scales. Functional networks recovered from long windows of neural activity (minutes) largely overlap with the underlying structural network. As a result, hubs in these long-run functional networks correspond to structural hubs. In contrast, significant fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence of networks recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time windows. The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds) we detect individual episodes of interregional phase-locking and find that slow variations in the statistics of these transient episodes, contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent correlation patterns observed on slower time scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Honey","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Kötter","given":"Rolf"},{"family":"Breakspear","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Sporns","given":"Olaf"}],"citation-key":"honeyetal_NetworkStructureCerebral_2007","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

When neuronal activity, as measured using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks—including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time—can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (\n              i\n              ) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (\n              ii\n              ) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (\n              iii\n              ) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Honey","given":"C.

Medial frontal and frontoparietal networks appear to be both unique and stable, resulting in high ID rates, as did a combination of these two networks. We conduct analyses demonstrating that these results are not driven by head motion. We also show that edges contributing the most to a successful ID tend to connect nodes in the frontal and parietal cortices, while edges contributing the least tend to connect cross-hemispheric homologs.

Using this new knowledge, this paper provides revised estimates for the energy expenditure on neural computation in a simple model for the cerebral cortex and a detailed model of the cerebellar cortex. In cerebral cortex, most signaling energy (50%) is used on postsynaptic glutamate receptors, 21% is used on action potentials, 20% on resting potentials, 5% on presynaptic transmitter release, and 4% on transmitter recycling. In the cerebellar cortex, excitatory neurons use 75% and inhibitory neurons 25% of the signaling energy, and most energy is used on information processing by non-principal neurons: Purkinje cells use only 15% of the signaling energy. The majority of cerebellar signaling energy use is on the maintenance of resting potentials (54%) and postsynaptic receptors (22%), while action potentials account for only 17% of the signaling energy use.","author":[{"family":"Howarth","given":"Clare"},{"family":"Gleeson","given":"Padraig"},{"family":"Attwell","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"howarthetal_UpdatedEnergyBudgets_2012","container-title":"Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism: Official Journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism","container-title-short":"J Cereb Blood Flow Metab","DOI":"10.1038/jcbfm.2012.35","ISSN":"1559-7016","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"1222-1232","PMCID":"PMC3390818","PMID":"22434069","source":"PubMed","title":"Updated energy budgets for neural computation in the neocortex and cerebellum","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},

Cajal, by contrast, by the time he was awarded the Nobel Prize, was already breaking new ground with a new staining technique in the field of peripheral nerve regeneration, seeing the reconstruction of a severed nerve by sprouting from the proximal stump as another manifestation of the Neuron Doctrine.

Once it has been ascertained that there is such association through testing, then a next step, often ignored, is to explore and uncover the association’s underlying patterns., This article provides a survey of various measures of dependence between random vectors and tests of independence and emphasizes the connections and differences between the various approaches. After providing definitions of the coefficients and associated tests, we present the recent improvements that enhance their statistical properties and ease of interpretation.

  {"id":"krausetal_InsightsPersonalizedModels_2023","abstract":"A main goal in translational neuroscience is to identify neural correlates of psychopathology (“biomarkers”) that can be used to facilitate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. This goal has led to substantial research into how psychopathology symptoms relate to large-scale brain systems. However, these efforts have not yet resulted in practical biomarkers used in clinical practice. One reason for this underwhelming progress may be that many study designs focus on increasing sample size instead of collecting additional data within each individual. This focus limits the reliability and predictive validity of brain and behavioral measures in any one person. As biomarkers exist at the level of individuals, an increased focus on validating them within individuals is warranted. We argue that personalized models, estimated from extensive data collection within individuals, can address these concerns. We review evidence from two, thus far separate, lines of research on personalized models of (1) psychopathology symptoms and (2) fMRI measures of brain networks. We close by proposing approaches uniting personalized models across both domains to improve biomarker research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Kraus","given":"Brian T."},{"family":"Zinbarg","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Braga","given":"Rodrigo M."},{"family":"Nusslock","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Mittal","given":"Vijay A."},{"family":"Gratton","given":"Caterina"}],"citation-key":"krausetal_InsightsPersonalizedModels_2023","container-title":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","container-title-short":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2023.105259","ISSN":"0149-7634","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"105259","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Insights from Personalized Models of Brain and Behavior for Identifying Biomarkers in Psychiatry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763423002282"},

To better understand the range and central tendencies of network configurations, coupling patterns were explored using functional MRI (fMRI) across 14 distinct continuously performed task states ranging from passive fixation to increasingly demanding classification tasks. Mean global correlation profiles across the cortex ranged from 0.69 to 0.82 between task states. Network configurations from both passive fixation and classification tasks similarly predicted task coactivation patterns estimated from meta-analysis of the literature. Thus, even across markedly different task states, central tendencies dominate the coupling configurations. Beyond these shared components, distinct task states displayed significant differences in coupling patterns in response to their varied demands. One possibility is that anatomical connectivity provides constraints that act as attractors pulling network configurations towards a limited number of robust states. Reconfigurable coupling modes emerge as significant modifications to a core functional architecture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Krienen","given":"Fenna M."},{"family":"Yeo","given":"B.

Unlike EEG source reconstruction, scalp analysis does not allow to make inferences about interacting regions, yet this latter approach has not been abandoned. Although the two approaches use different assumptions, conclusions drawn regarding the topology of the underlying networks should, ideally, not depend on the approach. The aim of the present work was to find an answer to the following questions: does scalp analysis provide a correct estimate of the network topology? how big are the distortions when using various pipelines in different experimental conditions? EEG recordings were analysed with amplitude- and phase-based metrics, founding a strong correlation for the global connectivity between scalp- and source-level. In contrast, network topology was only weakly correlated. The strongest correlations were obtained for MST leaf fraction, but only for FC metrics that limit the effects of volume conduction/signal leakage. These findings suggest that these effects alter the estimated EEG network organization, limiting the interpretation of results of scalp analysis. Finally, this study also suggests that the use of metrics that address the problem of zero lag correlations may give more reliable estimates of the underlying network topology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Lai","given":"Margherita"},{"family":"Demuru","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Hillebrand","given":"Arjan"},{"family":"Fraschini","given":"Matteo"}],"citation-key":"laietal_ComparisonScalpSourcereconstructed_2018","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-30869-w","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,16]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-8","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A comparison between scalp- and source-reconstructed EEG networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30869-w","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"laroccaetal_HumanBrainDistinctiveness_2014","abstract":"The use of EEG biometrics, for the purpose of automatic people recognition, has received increasing attention in the recent years. Most of the current analyses rely on the extraction of features characterizing the activity of single brain regions, like power spectrum estimation, thus neglecting possible temporal dependencies between the generated EEG signals. However, important physiological information can be extracted from the way different brain regions are functionally coupled. In this study, we propose a novel approach that fuses spectral coherence-based connectivity between different brain regions as a possibly viable biometric feature. The proposed approach is tested on a large dataset of subjects (N = 108) during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting state conditions. The obtained recognition performance shows that using brain connectivity leads to higher distinctiveness with respect to power-spectrum measurements, in both the experimental conditions. Notably, a 100% recognition accuracy is obtained in EC and EO when integrating functional connectivity between regions in the frontal lobe, while a lower 97.5% is obtained in EC (96.26% in EO) when fusing power spectrum information from parieto-occipital (centro-parietal in EO) regions. Taken together, these results suggest that the functional connectivity patterns represent effective features for improving EEG-based biometric systems.","author":[{"family":"La Rocca","given":"Daria"},{"family":"Campisi","given":"P."},{"family":"Vegso","given":"B."},{"family":"Cserti","given":"P."},{"family":"Kozmann","given":"G."},{"family":"Babiloni","given":"F."},{"family":"Fallani","given":"F.

We report a reproducible and internally valid subject-specific areal-level parcellation that corresponds with subject-specific task activations. Highly convergent correlation network estimates can be derived from this parcellation if sufficient data are collected—considerably more than typically acquired. Notably, within-subject correlation variability across sessions exhibited a heterogeneous distribution across the cortex concentrated in visual and somato-motor regions, distinct from the pattern of intersubject variability. Further, although the individual’s systems-level organization is broadly similar to the group, it demonstrates distinct topological features.

The estimand is the target quantity—the purpose of the statistical analysis. Much attention is already placed on how to do estimation; a similar degree of care should be given to defining the thing we are estimating. We advocate that authors state the central quantity of each analysis—the theoretical estimand—in precise terms that exist outside of any statistical model. In our framework, researchers do three things: (1) set a theoretical estimand, clearly connecting this quantity to theory; (2) link to an empirical estimand, which is informative about the theoretical estimand under some identification assumptions; and (3) learn from data. Adding precise estimands to research practice expands the space of theoretical questions, clarifies how evidence can speak to those questions, and unlocks new tools for estimation.

This baseline is characterized by slow (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations of functional imaging signals that are topographically organized in discrete brain networks, and by much faster (1–80 Hz) electrical oscillations. To investigate the relationship between hemodynamic and electrical oscillations, we have adopted a completely data-driven approach that combines information from simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using independent component analysis on the fMRI data, we identified six widely distributed resting state networks. The blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations associated with each network were correlated with the EEG power variations of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma rhythms. Each functional network was characterized by a specific electrophysiological signature that involved the combination of different brain rhythms. Moreover, the joint EEG/fMRI analysis afforded a finer physiological fractionation of brain networks in the resting human brain. This result supports for the first time in humans the coalescence of several brain rhythms within large-scale brain networks as suggested by biophysical studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Mantini","given":"D."},{"family":"Perrucci","given":"M.

One method that harnesses such individual signatures is functional connectome fingerprinting, which can reliably identify individuals from large study populations. However, the precise relationship between functional signatures underlying fingerprinting and behavioural prediction remains unclear. Expanding on previous reports, here we systematically investigate the link between discrimination and prediction on different levels of brain network organisation (individual connections, network interactions, topographical organisation, and connection variability). Our analysis revealed a substantial divergence between discriminatory and predictive connectivity signatures on all levels of network organisation. Across different brain parcellations, thresholds, and prediction algorithms, we find discriminatory connections in higher-order multimodal association cortices, while neural correlates of behaviour display more variable distributions. Furthermore, we find the standard deviation of connections between participants to be significantly higher in fingerprinting than in prediction, making inter-individual connection variability a possible separating marker. These results demonstrate that participant identification and behavioural prediction involve highly distinct functional systems of the human connectome. The present study thus calls into question the direct functional relevance of connectome fingerprints.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Mantwill","given":"Maron"},{"family":"Gell","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Krohn","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Finke","given":"Carsten"}],"citation-key":"mantwilletal_BrainConnectivityFingerprinting_2022","container-title":"Communications Biology","container-title-short":"Commun Biol","DOI":"10.1038/s42003-022-03185-3","ISSN":"2399-3642","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,24]]},"language":"en","page":"261","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Brain connectivity fingerprinting and behavioural prediction rest on distinct functional systems of the human connectome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03185-3","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"mareketal_ReproducibleBrainWideAssociation_2020","abstract":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to drive many important neuroscientific advances. However, progress in uncovering reproducible associations between individual differences in brain structure/function and behavioral phenotypes (e.g., cognition, mental health) may have been undermined by typical neuroimaging sample sizes (median N=25) 1,2. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study 3 (N=11,878), we estimated the effect sizes and reproducibility of these brain-wide associations studies (BWAS) as a function of sample size. The very largest, replicable brain-wide associations for univariate and multivariate methods were r=0.14 and r=0.34, respectively. In smaller samples, typical for brain-wide association studies (BWAS), irreproducible, inflated effect sizes were ubiquitous, no matter the method (univariate, multivariate). Until sample sizes started to approach consortium-levels, BWAS were underpowered and statistical errors assured. Multiple factors contribute to replication failures 4-6; here, we show that the pairing of small brain-behavioral phenotype effect sizes with sampling variability is a key element in wide-spread BWAS replication failure. Brain-behavioral phenotype associations stabilize and become more reproducible with sample sizes of N⪆2,000. While investigator-initiated brain-behavior research continues to generate hypotheses and propel innovation, large consortia are needed to usher in a new era of reproducible human brain-wide association studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Marek","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Tervo-Clemmens","given":"Brenden"},{"family":"Calabro","given":"Finnegan J."},{"family":"Montez","given":"David F."},{"family":"Kay","given":"Benjamin P."},{"family":"Hatoum","given":"Alexander S."},{"family":"Donohue","given":"Meghan Rose"},{"family":"Foran","given":"William"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Ryland L."},{"family":"Feczko","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Miranda-Dominguez","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Alice M."},{"family":"Earl","given":"Eric A."},{"family":"Perrone","given":"Anders J."},{"family":"Cordova","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Doyle","given":"Olivia"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Lucille A."},{"family":"Conan","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Uriarte","given":"Johnny"},{"family":"Snider","given":"Kathy"},{"family":"Tam","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jianzhong"},{"family":"Newbold","given":"Dillan J."},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Annie"},{"family":"Seider","given":"Nicole A."},{"family":"Van","given":"Andrew N."},{"family":"Laumann","given":"Timothy O."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Wesley K."},{"family":"Greene","given":"Deanna J."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Steven E."},{"family":"Nichols","given":"Thomas E."},{"family":"Yeo","given":"B.

  {"id":"mayeretal_ExploratoryAnalysisMultiple_2011","abstract":"The integration of multiple high-dimensional data sets (omics data) has been a very active but challenging area of bioinformatics research in recent years. Various adaptations of non-standard multivariate statistical tools have been suggested that allow to analyze and visualize such data sets simultaneously. However, these methods typically can deal with two data sets only, whereas systems biology experiments often generate larger numbers of high-dimensional data sets. For this reason, we suggest an explorative analysis of similarity between data sets as an initial analysis steps. This analysis is based on the RV coefficient, a matrix correlation, that can be interpreted as a generalization of the squared correlation from two single variables to two sets of variables. It has been shown before however that the high-dimensionality of the data introduces substantial bias to the RV.We therefore introduce an alternative version, the adjusted RV, which is unbiased in the case of independent data sets. We can also show that in many situations, particularly for very high-dimensional data sets, the adjusted RV is a better estimator than previously RV versions in terms of the mean square error and the power of the independence test based on it. We demonstrate the usefulness of the adjusted RV by applying it to data set of 19 different multivariate data sets from a systems biology experiment. The pairwise RV values between the data sets define a similarity matrix that we can use as an input to a hierarchical clustering or a multi-dimensional scaling. We show that this reveals biological meaningful subgroups of data sets in our study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mayer","given":"Claus-Dieter"},{"family":"Lorent","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Horgan","given":"Graham W."}],"citation-key":"mayeretal_ExploratoryAnalysisMultiple_2011","container-title":"Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology","DOI":"10.2202/1544-6115.1540","ISSN":"1544-6115","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",3,2]]},"language":"en","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Exploratory Analysis of Multiple Omics Datasets Using the Adjusted RV Coefficient","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.2202/1544-6115.1540/html","volume":"10"},

Source imaging is a principal objective for electroencephalography (EEG), the solutions of which require forward problem (FP) computations characterising the electric potential distribution on the scalp due to known sources. Additionally, the EEG-FP is dependent upon realistic, anatomically correct volume conductors and accurate tissue conductivities, where the skull is particularly important. Skull conductivity, however, deviates according to bone composition and the presence of adult sutures. The presented study therefore analyses the effect the presence of adult sutures and differing bone composition have on the EEG-FP and inverse problem (IP) solutions.\n              Approach\n              . Utilising a well-established head atlas, detailed head models were generated including compact and spongiform bone and adult sutures. The true skull conductivity was considered as inhomogeneous according to spongiform bone proportion and sutures. The EEG-FP and EEG-IP were solved and compared to results employing homogeneous skull models, with varying conductivities and omitting sutures, as well as using a hypothesised aging skull conductivity model.\n              Main results\n              . Significant localised FP errors, with relative error up to 85%, were revealed, particularly evident along suture lines and directly related to the proportion of spongiform bone.

  {"id":"michelbrunet_EEGSourceImaging_2019","abstract":"The electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the oldest technologies to measure neuronal activity of the human brain. It has its undisputed value in clinical diagnosis, particularly (but not exclusively) in the identification of epilepsy and sleep disorders and in the evaluation of dysfunctions in sensory transmission pathways. With the advancement of digital technologies, the analysis of EEG has moved from pure visual inspection of amplitude and frequency modulations over time to a comprehensive exploration of the temporal and spatial characteristics of the recorded signals. Today, EEG is accepted as a powerful tool to capture brain function with the unique advantage of measuring neuronal processes in the time frame in which these processes occur, namely in the sub-second range. However, it is generally stated that EEG suffers from a poor spatial resolution that makes it difficult to infer to the location of the brain areas generating the neuronal activity measured on the scalp. This statement has challenged a whole community of biomedical engineers to offer solutions to localize more precisely and more reliably the generators of the EEG activity. High-density EEG systems combined with precise information of the head anatomy and sophisticated source localization algorithms now exist that convert the EEG to a true neuroimaging modality. With these tools in hand and with the fact that EEG still remains versatile, inexpensive and portable, electrical neuroimaging has become a widely used technology to study the functions of the pathological and healthy human brain. However, several steps are needed to pass from the recording of the EEG to 3-dimensional images of neuronal activity. This review explains these different steps and illustrates them in a comprehensive analysis pipeline integrated in a stand-alone freely available academic software: Cartool.

  {"id":"michelkoenig_EEGMicrostatesTool_2018","abstract":"The present review discusses a well-established method for characterizing resting-state activity of the human brain using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG). This method involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field remains semi-stable, suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across time, can be reliably identified across participants. Researchers have proposed that these microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of mentation. Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI studies and EEG source imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-state networks as identified using fMRI. The scale-free properties of the time series of EEG microstates explain why similar networks can be observed at such different time scales. The present review will provide an overview of these EEG microstates, available methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding these microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Michel","given":"Christoph M."},{"family":"Koenig","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"michelkoenig_EEGMicrostatesTool_2018","collection-title":"Brain Connectivity Dynamics","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"NeuroImage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.062","ISSN":"1053-8119","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,15]]},"language":"en","page":"577-593","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"EEG microstates as a tool for studying the temporal dynamics of whole-brain neuronal networks: A review","title-short":"EEG microstates as a tool for studying the temporal dynamics of whole-brain neuronal networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191731008X","volume":"180"},
  {"id":"miranda-dominguezetal_ConnectotypingModelBased_2014","abstract":"A better characterization of how an individual’s brain is functionally organized will likely bring dramatic advances to many fields of study. Here we show a model-based approach toward characterizing resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) that is capable of identifying a so-called “connectotype”, or functional fingerprint in individual participants. The approach rests on a simple linear model that proposes the activity of a given brain region can be described by the weighted sum of its functional neighboring regions. The resulting coefficients correspond to a personalized model-based connectivity matrix that is capable of predicting the timeseries of each subject. Importantly, the model itself is subject specific and has the ability to predict an individual at a later date using a limited number of non-sequential frames. While we show that there is a significant amount of shared variance between models across subjects, the model’s ability to discriminate an individual is driven by unique connections in higher order control regions in frontal and parietal cortices. Furthermore, we show that the connectotype is present in non-human primates as well, highlighting the translational potential of the approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Miranda-Dominguez","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Mills","given":"Brian D."},{"family":"Carpenter","given":"Samuel D."},{"family":"Grant","given":"Kathleen A."},{"family":"Kroenke","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Nigg","given":"Joel T."},{"family":"Fair","given":"Damien A."}],"citation-key":"miranda-dominguezetal_ConnectotypingModelBased_2014","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0111048","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,11]]},"language":"en","page":"e111048","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Connectotyping: Model Based Fingerprinting of the Functional Connectome","title-short":"Connectotyping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111048","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"moonetal_ContributionExcitatoryInhibitory_2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            The BOLD fMRI response in the cortex is often assumed to reflect changes in excitatory neural activity. However, the contribution of inhibitory neurons to BOLD fMRI is unclear. Here, the role of inhibitory and excitatory activity was examined using multimodal approaches: electrophysiological recording, 15.2 T fMRI, optical intrinsic signal imaging, and modeling. Inhibitory and excitatory neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex were selectively modulated by 20-s optogenetic stimulation of VGAT-ChR2 and CaMKII-ChR2 mice, respectively. Somatosensory stimulation and optogenetic stimulation of excitatory neurons induced positive BOLD responses in the somatosensory network, whereas stimulation of inhibitory neurons produced biphasic responses at the stimulation site, initial positive and later negative BOLD signals, and negative BOLD responses at downstream sites. When the stimulation duration was reduced to 5 s, the hemodynamic response of VGAT-ChR2 mice to optogenetic stimulation was only positive. Lastly, modeling performed from neuronal and hemodynamic data shows that the hemodynamic response function (HRF) of excitatory neurons is similar across different conditions, whereas the HRF of inhibitory neurons is highly sensitive to stimulation frequency and peaks earlier than that of excitatory neurons. Our study provides insights into the neurovascular coupling of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and the interpretation of BOLD fMRI signals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Moon","given":"Hyun Seok"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Haiyan"},{"family":"Vo","given":"Thanh Tan"},{"family":"Jung","given":"Won Beom"},{"family":"Vazquez","given":"Alberto L"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Seong-Gi"}],"citation-key":"moonetal_ContributionExcitatoryInhibitory_2021","container-title":"Cerebral Cortex","DOI":"10.1093/cercor/bhab068","ISSN":"1047-3211, 1460-2199","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,29]]},"language":"en","page":"4053-4067","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Contribution of Excitatory and Inhibitory Neuronal Activity to BOLD fMRI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/31/9/4053/6248484","volume":"31"},
  {"id":"mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021","abstract":"Functional connectivity of neural oscillations (oscillation-based FC) is thought to afford dynamic information exchange across task-relevant neural ensembles. Although oscillation-based FC is classically defined relative to a prestimulus baseline, giving rise to rapid, context-dependent changes in individual connections, studies of distributed spatial patterns show that oscillation-based FC is omnipresent, occurring even in the absence of explicit cognitive demands. Thus, the issue of whether oscillation-based FC is primarily shaped by cognitive state or is intrinsic in nature remains open. Accordingly, we sought to reconcile these observations by interrogating the ECoG recordings of 18 presurgical human patients (8 females) for state dependence of oscillation-based FC in five canonical frequency bands across an array of six task states. FC analysis of phase and amplitude coupling revealed a highly similar, largely state-invariant (i.e., intrinsic) spatial component across cognitive states. This spatial organization was shared across all frequency bands. Crucially, however, each band also exhibited temporally independent FC dynamics capable of supporting frequency-specific information exchange. In conclusion, the spatial organization of oscillation-based FC is largely stable over cognitive states (i.e., primarily intrinsic in nature) and shared across frequency bands. Together, our findings converge with previous observations of spatially invariant patterns of FC derived from extremely slow and aperiodic fluctuations in fMRI signals. Our observations indicate that “background” FC should be accounted for in conceptual frameworks of oscillation-based FC targeting task-related changes.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A fundamental property of neural activity is that it is periodic, enabling functional connectivity (FC) between distant regions through coupling of their oscillations. According to task-based studies, such oscillation-based FC is rapid and malleable to meet cognitive task demands. Studying distributed FC patterns instead of FC in a few individual connections, we found that oscillation-based FC is largely stable across various cognitive states and shares a common layout across oscillation frequencies. This stable spatial organization of FC in fast oscillatory brain signals parallels the known stability of fMRI-based intrinsic FC architecture. Despite the observed spatial state and frequency invariance, FC of individual connections was temporally independent between frequency bands, suggesting a putative mechanism for malleable frequency-specific FC to support cognitive tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Mostame","given":"Parham"},{"family":"Sadaghiani","given":"Sepideh"}],"citation-key":"mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

Here, we used repeated-measurement resting-state functional MRI to explore intersubject variability in connectivity. Individual differences in functional connectivity were heterogeneous across the cortex, with significantly higher variability in heteromodal association cortex and lower variability in unimodal cortices. Intersubject variability in connectivity was significantly correlated with the degree of evolutionary cortical expansion, suggesting a potential evolutionary root of functional variability. The connectivity variability was also related to variability in sulcal depth but not cortical thickness, positively correlated with the degree of long-range connectivity but negatively correlated with local connectivity. A meta-analysis further revealed that regions predicting individual differences in cognitive domains are predominantly located in regions of high connectivity variability.

  {"id":"nentwichetal_FunctionalConnectivityEEG_2020","abstract":"A variety of psychiatric, behavioral and cognitive phenotypes have been linked to brain ‘’functional connectivity’’ -- the pattern of correlation observed between different brain regions. Most commonly assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), here, we investigate the connectivity-phenotype associations with functional connectivity measured with electroencephalography (EEG), using phase-coupling. We analyzed data from the publicly available Healthy Brain Network Biobank. This database compiles a growing sample of children and adolescents, currently encompassing 1657 individuals. Among a variety of assessment instruments we focus on ten phenotypic and additional demographic measures that capture most of the variance in this sample. The largest effect sizes are found for age and sex for both fMRI and EEG. We replicate previous findings of an association of Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with the pattern of fMRI functional connectivity. We also find an association with socioeconomic status, anxiety and the Child Behavior Checklist Score. For EEG we find a significant connectivity-phenotype relationship with IQ. The actual spatial patterns of functional connectivity are quite different between fMRI and source-space EEG. However, within EEG we observe clusters of functional connectivity that are consistent across frequency bands. Additionally we analyzed reproducibility of functional connectivity. We compare connectivity obtained with different tasks, including resting state, a video and a visual flicker task. For both EEG and fMRI the variation between tasks was smaller than the variability observed between subjects. We also found an increase of reliability with increasing frequency of the EEG, and increased sampling duration. We conclude that, while the patterns of functional connectivity are distinct between fMRI and phase-coupling of EEG, they are nonetheless similar in their robustness to the task, and similar in that idiosyncratic patterns of connectivity predict individual phenotypes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nentwich","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Ai","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Telesford","given":"Qawi K."},{"family":"Haufe","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Milham","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Parra","given":"Lucas C."}],"citation-key":"nentwichetal_FunctionalConnectivityEEG_2020","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"NeuroImage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117001","ISSN":"1053-8119","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"117001","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Functional connectivity of EEG is subject-specific, associated with phenotype, and different from fMRI","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920304870","volume":"218"},

By accentuating the effects of this agent through the use of gradient-echo techniques in high fields, we demonstrate in vivo images of brain microvasculature with image contrast reflecting the blood oxygen level. This blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast follows blood oxygen changes induced by anesthetics, by insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and by inhaled gas mixtures that alter metabolic demand or blood flow. The results suggest that BOLD contrast can be used to provide in vivo real-time maps of blood oxygenation in the brain under normal physiological conditions.

  {"id":"pangetal_GeometricConstraintsHuman_2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              The anatomy of the brain necessarily constrains its function, but precisely how remains unclear. The classical and dominant paradigm in neuroscience is that neuronal dynamics are driven by interactions between discrete, functionally specialized cell populations connected by a complex array of axonal fibres\n              1–3\n              . However, predictions from neural field theory, an established mathematical framework for modelling large-scale brain activity\n              4–6\n              , suggest that the geometry of the brain may represent a more fundamental constraint on dynamics than complex interregional connectivity\n              7,8\n              . Here, we confirm these theoretical predictions by analysing human magnetic resonance imaging data acquired under spontaneous and diverse task-evoked conditions. Specifically, we show that cortical and subcortical activity can be parsimoniously understood as resulting from excitations of fundamental, resonant modes of the brain’s geometry (that is, its shape) rather than from modes of complex interregional connectivity, as classically assumed. We then use these geometric modes to show that task-evoked activations across over 10,000 brain maps are not confined to focal areas, as widely believed, but instead excite brain-wide modes with wavelengths spanning over 60 mm. Finally, we confirm predictions that the close link between geometry and function is explained by a dominant role for wave-like activity, showing that wave dynamics can reproduce numerous canonical spatiotemporal properties of spontaneous and evoked recordings. Our findings challenge prevailing views and identify a previously underappreciated role of geometry in shaping function, as predicted by a unifying and physically principled model of brain-wide dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Pang","given":"James C."},{"family":"Aquino","given":"Kevin M."},{"family":"Oldehinkel","given":"Marianne"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Fulcher","given":"Ben D."},{"family":"Breakspear","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Fornito","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"pangetal_GeometricConstraintsHuman_2023","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-023-06098-1","ISSN":"0028-0836, 1476-4687","issue":"7965","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,15]]},"language":"en","page":"566-574","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Geometric constraints on human brain function","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06098-1","volume":"618"},
  {"id":"parraetal_DementiaLatinAmerica_2018","abstract":"The demographic structure of Latin American countries (LAC) is fast approaching that of developing countries, and the predicted prevalence of dementia in the former already exceeds the latter. Dementia has been declared a global challenge, yet regions around the world show differences in both the nature and magnitude of such a challenge. This article provides evidence and insights on barriers which, if overcome, would enable the harmonization of strategies to tackle the dementia challenge in LAC. First, we analyze the lack of available epidemiologic data, the need for standardizing clinical practice and improving physician training, and the existing barriers regarding resources, culture, and stigmas. We discuss how these are preventing timely care and research. Regarding specific health actions, most LAC have minimal mental health facilities and do not have specific mental health policies or budgets specific to dementia. In addition, local regulations may need to consider the regional context when developing treatment and prevention strategies. The support needed nationally and internationally to enable a smooth and timely transition of LAC to a position that integrates global strategies is highlighted. We focus on shared issues of poverty, cultural barriers, and socioeconomic vulnerability. We identify avenues for collaboration aimed to study unique populations, improve valid assessment methods, and generate opportunities for translational research, thus establishing a regional network. The issues identified here point to future specific actions aimed at tackling the dementia challenge in LAC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Parra","given":"Mario A."},{"family":"Baez","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Allegri","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Nitrini","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Lopera","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Slachevsky","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Custodio","given":"Nilton"},{"family":"Lira","given":"David"},{"family":"Piguet","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Kumfor","given":"Fiona"},{"family":"Huepe","given":"David"},{"family":"Cogram","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Bak","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Manes","given":"Facundo"},{"family":"Ibanez","given":"Agustin"}],"citation-key":"parraetal_DementiaLatinAmerica_2018","container-title":"Neurology","container-title-short":"Neurology","DOI":"10.1212/WNL.0000000000004897","ISSN":"0028-3878, 1526-632X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,30]]},"language":"en","page":"222-231","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dementia in Latin America: Assessing the present and envisioning the future","title-short":"Dementia in Latin America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000004897","volume":"90"},

  {"id":"poweretal_CriticalEventRelatedAppraisal_2020","abstract":"This article advances two parallel lines of argument about resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, one empirical and one conceptual. The empirical line creates a four-part organization of the text: (1) head motion and respiration commonly cause distinct, major, unwanted influences (artifacts) in fMRI signals; (2) head motion and respiratory changes are, confoundingly, both related to psychological and clinical and biological variables of interest; (3) many fMRI denoising strategies fail to identify and remove one or the other kind of artifact; and (4) unremoved artifact, due to correlations of artifacts with variables of interest, renders studies susceptible to identifying variance of noninterest as variance of interest. Arising from these empirical observations is a conceptual argument: that an event-related approach to task-free scans, targeting common behaviors during scanning, enables fundamental distinctions among the kinds of signals present in the data, information which is vital to understanding the effects of denoising procedures. This event-related perspective permits statements like \"Event X is associated with signals A, B, and C, each with particular spatial, temporal, and signal decay properties\". Denoising approaches can then be tailored, via performance in known events, to permit or suppress certain kinds of signals based on their desirability.","author":[{"family":"Power","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Lynch","given":"Charles J."},{"family":"Adeyemo","given":"Babatunde"},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Steven E."}],"citation-key":"poweretal_CriticalEventRelatedAppraisal_2020","container-title":"Cerebral Cortex (New York, N.Y.: 1991)","container-title-short":"Cereb Cortex","DOI":"10.1093/cercor/bhaa139","ISSN":"1460-2199","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,3]]},"language":"eng","page":"5544-5559","PMID":"32494823","source":"PubMed","title":"A Critical, Event-Related Appraisal of Denoising in Resting-State fMRI Studies","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

In this report we examine impact of motion on signal intensity and RSFC correlations. We find that motion-induced signal changes (1) are often complex and variable waveforms, (2) are often shared across nearly all brain voxels, and (3) often persist more than 10s after motion ceases. These signal changes, both during and after motion, increase observed RSFC correlations in a distance-dependent manner. Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a variety of motion-based regressors, but are effectively reduced by global signal regression. We link several measures of data quality to motion, changes in signal intensity, and changes in RSFC correlations. We demonstrate that improvements in data quality measures during processing may represent cosmetic improvements rather than true correction of the data. We demonstrate a within-subject, censoring-based artifact removal strategy based on volume censoring that reduces group differences due to motion to chance levels. We note conditions under which group-level regressions do and do not correct motion-related effects.","author":[{"family":"Power","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Mitra","given":"Anish"},{"family":"Laumann","given":"Timothy O."},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Abraham Z."},{"family":"Schlaggar","given":"Bradley L."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Steven E."}],"citation-key":"poweretal_MethodsDetectCharacterize_2014","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.08.048","ISSN":"1095-9572","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"320-341","PMCID":"PMC3849338","PMID":"23994314","source":"PubMed","title":"Methods to detect, characterize, and remove motion artifact in resting state fMRI","type":"article-journal","volume":"84"},

These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance correlations are increased. These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and the need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not have adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements.","author":[{"family":"Power","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Barnes","given":"Kelly A."},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Abraham Z."},{"family":"Schlaggar","given":"Bradley L."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Steven E."}],"citation-key":"poweretal_SpuriousSystematicCorrelations_2012","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.018","ISSN":"1095-9572","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"2142-2154","PMCID":"PMC3254728","PMID":"22019881","source":"PubMed","title":"Spurious but systematic correlations in functional connectivity MRI networks arise from subject motion","type":"article-journal","volume":"59"},

The nature of this intrinsic activity, which exhibits a surprising level of organization with dimensions of both space and time, is revealed in the ongoing activity of the brain and its metabolism. As we look to the future, understanding the nature of this intrinsic activity will require integrating knowledge from cognitive and systems neuroscience with cellular and molecular neuroscience where ion channels, receptors, components of signal transduction and metabolic pathways are all in a constant state of flux. The reward for doing so will be a much better understanding of human behaviour in health and disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Raichle","given":"Marcus E."}],"citation-key":"raichle_RestlessBrainHow_2015","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2014.0172","ISSN":"0962-8436","issue":"1668","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,19]]},"PMCID":"PMC4387513","PMID":"25823869","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The restless brain: how intrinsic activity organizes brain function","title-short":"The restless brain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387513/","volume":"370"},

  {"id":"raichleetal_DefaultModeBrain_2001","abstract":"A baseline or control state is fundamental to the understanding of most complex systems. Defining a baseline state in the human brain, arguably our most complex system, poses a particular challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction or OEF. The OEF is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations in the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to obtain the OEF regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation were conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from the mean hemisphere OEF were increases, signifying deactivations, and resided almost exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that consistently exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide variety of goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission tomography and functional MRI. These decreases suggest the existence of an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors.","author":[{"family":"Raichle","given":"Marcus E."},{"family":"MacLeod","given":"A.

  {"id":"rolandzilles_StructuralDivisionsFunctional_1998","abstract":"The question of what is a cortical area needs a thorough definition of borders both in the microstructural and the functional domains. Microstructural parcellation of the human cerebral cortex should be made on multiple criteria based on quantitative measurements of microstructural variables, such as neuron densities, neurotransmitter receptor densities, enzyme densities, etc. Because of the inter-individual variations of extent and topography of microstructurally defined areas, the final microstructurally defined areas appear as population maps. In the functional domain, columns, patches and blobs signifying synaptically active parts of the cortex appear as cortical functional fields. These fields are the largest functional entities of the cerebral cortex according to the cortical field hypothesis. In its strong version, the cortical field hypothesis postulates that all neurons and synapses within the fields perform a co-operative computation. A number of such fields together provide the functional contribution of the cerebral cortex. The functional parcellation of the human cerebral cortex must be based on field population maps, which after intersection analysis appear as functional domains. The major structural-functional hypothesis to be examined is whether these functional domains are equi-territorial to the microstructurally defined meta-maps. The cortical hypothesis predicts that, if two brain tasks make use of one or several identical or largely overlapping fields, they cannot be performed simultaneously without errors or increases in latency. Evidence for such interference is presented. This evidence represents a restriction in the parallel processing of the human brain. In the posterior part of the brain not only visual cortical areas may qualify for parallel processing, but also the somatosensory cortices appear to have separate functional streams for the detection of microgeometry and macrogeometry.","author":[{"family":"Roland","given":"P.

  {"id":"rosenbergetal_BehavioralNeuralSignatures_2020","abstract":"Working memory function changes across development and varies across individuals. The patterns of behavior and brain function that track individual differences in working memory during human development, however, are not well understood. Here we establish associations between working memory, cognitive abilities, and functional MRI activation in data from over 11,500 9–11-year-old children (both sexes) enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, an ongoing longitudinal study in the United States. Behavioral analyses reveal robust relationships between working memory, short-term memory, language skills, and fluid intelligence. Analyses relating out-of-scanner working memory performance to memory-related fMRI activation in an emotional n-back task demonstrate that frontoparietal activity specifically during a working memory challenge indexes working memory performance. This relationship is domain-specific, such that fMRI activation related to emotion processing during the emotional n-back task, inhibitory control during a stop-signal task, and reward processing during a monetary incentive delay task does not track memory abilities. Together these results inform our understanding of individual differences in working memory in childhood and lay the groundwork for characterizing the ways in which they change across adolescence.\nSignificance statement\nWorking memory is a foundational cognitive ability that changes over time and varies across individuals.

Furthermore, while Van Dijk et al. demonstrated the effect of motion on seed-based connectivity analyses, it is not known how motion impacts other common measures of connectivity. Here we expand on the findings of Van Dijk et al. by examining the effect of motion on multiple types of resting-state connectivity analyses in a large sample of children and adolescents (n=456). Following replication of the effect of motion on seed-based analyses, we examine the influence of motion on graphical measures of network modularity, dual-regression of independent component analysis, as well as the amplitude and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation. In the entire sample, subject age was highly related to motion. Using a subsample where age and motion were unrelated, we demonstrate that motion has marked effects on connectivity in every analysis examined. While subject age was associated with increased within-network connectivity even when motion was accounted for, controlling for motion substantially attenuated the strength of this relationship. The results demonstrate the pervasive influence of motion on multiple types functional connectivity analysis, and underline the importance of accounting for motion in studies of neurodevelopment.","author":[{"family":"Satterthwaite","given":"Theodore D."},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Daniel H."},{"family":"Loughead","given":"James"},{"family":"Ruparel","given":"Kosha"},{"family":"Elliott","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Hakonarson","given":"Hakon"},{"family":"Gur","given":"Ruben C."},{"family":"Gur","given":"Raquel E."}],"citation-key":"satterthwaiteetal_ImpactInscannerHead_2012","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.12.063","ISSN":"1095-9572","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"623-632","PMCID":"PMC3746318","PMID":"22233733","source":"PubMed","title":"Impact of in-scanner head motion on multiple measures of functional connectivity: relevance for studies of neurodevelopment in youth","title-short":"Impact of in-scanner head motion on multiple measures of functional connectivity","type":"article-journal","volume":"60"},
  {"id":"saucematzel_CausesVariationLearning_2013","abstract":"In a seminal paper written five decades ago, Cronbach discussed the two highly distinct approaches to scientific psychology: experimental and correlational. Today, although these two approaches are fruitfully implemented and embraced across some fields of psychology, this synergy is largely absent from other areas, such as in the study of learning and behavior. Both Tolman and Hull, in a rare case of agreement, stated that the correlational approach held little promise for the understanding of behavior. Interestingly, this dismissal of the study of individual differences was absent in the biologically-oriented branches of behavior analysis, namely, behavioral genetics and ethology. Here we propose that the distinction between “causation” and “causes of variation” (with its origins in the field of genetics) reveal the potential value of the correlational approach in understanding the full complexity of learning and behavior. Although the experimental approach can illuminate the causal variables that modulate learning, the analysis of individual differences can elucidate how much and in which way variables interact to support variations in learning in complex natural environments. For example, understanding that a past experience with a stimulus influences its “associability” provides little insight into how individual predispositions interact to modulate this influence on associability. In this “new” light, we discuss examples from studies of individual differences in animals’ performance in the Morris Water Maze and from our own work on individual differences in general intelligence in mice. These studies illustrate that, opposed to what Underwood famously suggested, studies of individual differences can do much more to psychology than merely providing preliminary indications of cause-effect relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Sauce","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Matzel","given":"Louis D."}],"citation-key":"saucematzel_CausesVariationLearning_2013","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"schoffelengross_SourceConnectivityAnalysis_2009","abstract":"Interactions between functionally specialized brain regions are crucial for normal brain function. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) are techniques suited to capture these interactions, because they provide whole head measurements of brain activity in the millisecond range. More than one sensor picks up the activity of an underlying source. This field spread severely limits the utility of connectivity measures computed directly between sensor recordings. Consequentially, neuronal interactions should be studied on the level of the reconstructed sources. This article reviews several methods that have been applied to investigate interactions between brain regions in source space. We will mainly focus on the different measures used to quantify connectivity, and on the different strategies adopted to identify regions of interest. Despite various successful accounts of MEG and EEG source connectivity, caution with respect to the interpretation of the results is still warranted. This is due to the fact that effects of field spread can never be completely abolished in source space. However, in this very exciting and developing field of research this cautionary note should not discourage researchers from further investigation into the connectivity between neuronal sources.","author":[{"family":"Schoffelen","given":"Jan-Mathijs"},{"family":"Gross","given":"Joachim"}],"citation-key":"schoffelengross_SourceConnectivityAnalysis_2009","container-title":"Human Brain Mapping","container-title-short":"Hum Brain Mapp","DOI":"10.1002/hbm.20745","ISSN":"1097-0193","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"1857-1865","PMCID":"PMC6870611","PMID":"19235884","source":"PubMed","title":"Source connectivity analysis with MEG and EEG","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

Here, we used task-free connectivity analyses to isolate and characterize two distinct networks typically coactivated during functional MRI tasks. We identified a “salience network,” anchored by dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and orbital frontoinsular cortices with robust connectivity to subcortical and limbic structures, and an “executive-control network” that links dorsolateral frontal and parietal neocortices. These intrinsic connectivity networks showed dissociable correlations with functions measured outside the scanner. Prescan anxiety ratings correlated with intrinsic functional connectivity of the dACC node of the salience network, but with no region in the executive-control network, whereas executive task performance correlated with lateral parietal nodes of the executive-control network, but with no region in the salience network. Our findings suggest that task-free analysis of intrinsic connectivity networks may help elucidate the neural architectures that support fundamental aspects of human behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Seeley","given":"William W."},{"family":"Menon","given":"Vinod"},{"family":"Schatzberg","given":"Alan F."},{"family":"Keller","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Glover","given":"Gary H."},{"family":"Kenna","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Reiss","given":"Allan L."},{"family":"Greicius","given":"Michael D."}],"citation-key":"seeleyetal_DissociableIntrinsicConnectivity_2007","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

Recent work has revealed that functional networks identified in individuals contain local features that differ from the group-level description. We define these features as network variants. Building on these studies, we ask whether distributions of network variants reflect stable, trait-like differences in brain organization. Across several datasets of highly-sampled individuals we show that 1) variants are highly stable within individuals, 2) variants are found in characteristic locations and associate with characteristic functional networks across large groups, 3) task-evoked signals in variants demonstrate a link to functional variation, and 4) individuals cluster into subgroups on the basis of variant characteristics that are related to differences in behavior. These results suggest that distributions of network variants may reflect stable, trait-like, functionally relevant individual differences in functional brain organization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Seitzman","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Gratton","given":"Caterina"},{"family":"Laumann","given":"Timothy O."},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Evan M."},{"family":"Adeyemo","given":"Babatunde"},{"family":"Dworetsky","given":"Ally"},{"family":"Kraus","given":"Brian T."},{"family":"Gilmore","given":"Adrian W."},{"family":"Berg","given":"Jeffrey J."},{"family":"Ortega","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Annie"},{"family":"Greene","given":"Deanna J."},{"family":"McDermott","given":"Kathleen B."},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Steven M."},{"family":"Lessov-Schlaggar","given":"Christina N."},{"family":"Schlaggar","given":"Bradley L."},{"family":"Dosenbach","given":"Nico U.

Within these regions, beta/gamma phase-synchronization supports the integration of sensory functions, while synchronization in theta/alpha bands supports the regulation of attentional functions. A key challenge is to understand which mechanisms integrate neuronal processing across these distinct frequencies and thereby the sensory and attentional functions. We investigated whether such integration could be achieved by cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS). Using concurrent magneto- and electroencephalography, we found that CFS was load-dependently enhanced between theta and alpha–gamma and between alpha and beta-gamma oscillations during VWM maintenance among visual, FP, and dorsal attention (DA) systems. CFS also connected the hubs of within-frequency-synchronized networks and its strength predicted individual VWM capacity. We propose that CFS integrates processing among synchronized neuronal networks from theta to gamma frequencies to link sensory and attentional functions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Siebenhühner","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Sheng H"},{"family":"Palva","given":"J Matias"},{"family":"Palva","given":"Satu"}],"citation-key":"siebenhuhneretal_CrossfrequencySynchronizationConnects_2016","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.13451","ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,26]]},"language":"en","page":"e13451","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cross-frequency synchronization connects networks of fast and slow oscillations during visual working memory maintenance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/13451","volume":"5"},

However, functional connectivity (FC) is also a powerful feature to detect unique \"connectome fingerprints,\" allowing identification of individuals among their peers. Although fingerprinting has been robustly observed in samples of young adults, the reliability of this approach has not been demonstrated across the lifespan. We applied the fingerprinting framework to the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience cohort (n = 483 aged 18 to 89 years). We found that individuals are \"fingerprintable\" (i.e., identifiable) across independent functional MRI scans throughout the lifespan. We observed a U-shape distribution in the strength of \"self-identifiability\" (within-individual correlation across modalities), and \"others-identifiability\" (between-individual correlation across modalities), with a decrease from early adulthood into middle age, before improving in older age. FC edges contributing to self-identifiability were not restricted to specific brain networks and were different between individuals across the lifespan sample.

  {"id":"stametal_PhaseLagIndex_2007","abstract":"Objective: To address the problem of volume conduction and active reference electrodes in the assessment of functional connectivity, we propose a novel measure to quantify phase synchronization, the phase lag index (PLI), and compare its performance to the well-known phase coherence (PC), and to the imaginary component of coherency (IC). Methods: The PLI is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of phase differences between two signals. The performance of PLI, PC, and IC was examined in (i) a model of 64 globally coupled oscillators, (ii) an EEG with an absence seizure, (iii) an EEG data set of 15 Alzheimer patients and 13 control subjects, and (iv) two MEG data sets. Results: PLI and PC were more sensitive than IC to increasing levels of true synchronization in the model. PC and IC were influenced stronger than PLI by spurious correlations because of common sources. All measures detected changes in synchronization during the absence seizure. In contrast to PC, PLI and IC were barely changed by the choice of different montages. PLI and IC were superior to PC in detecting changes in beta band connectivity in AD patients. Finally, PLI and IC revealed a different spatial pattern of functional connectivity in MEG data than PC. Conclusion: The PLI performed at least as well as the PC in detecting true changes in synchronization in model and real data but, at the same token and like-wise the IC, it was much less affected by the influence of common sources and active reference electrodes.

  {"id":"tabernaetal_DetectionRestingStateFunctional_2021","abstract":"Recent technological advances have been permitted to use high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) for the estimation of functional connectivity and the mapping of resting-state networks (RSNs). The reliable estimate of activity and connectivity from hdEEG data relies on the creation of an accurate head model, defining how neural currents propagate from the cortex to the sensors placed over the scalp. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted yet to systematically test to what extent head modeling accuracy impacts on EEG-RSN reconstruction. To address this question, we used 256-channel hdEEG data collected in a group of young healthy participants at rest. We first estimated functional connectivity in EEG-RSNs by means of band-limited power envelope correlations, using neural activity estimated with an optimized analysis workflow. Then, we defined a series of head models with different levels of complexity, specifically testing the effect of different electrode positioning techniques and head tissue segmentation methods. We observed that robust EEG-RSNs can be obtained using a realistic head model, and that inaccuracies due to head tissue segmentation impact on RSN reconstruction more than those due to electrode positioning. Additionally, we found that EEG-RSN robustness to head model variations had space and frequency specificity. Overall, our results may contribute to defining a benchmark for assessing the reliability of hdEEG functional connectivity measures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Taberna","given":"Gaia Amaranta"},{"family":"Samogin","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Marino","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Mantini","given":"Dante"}],"citation-key":"tabernaetal_DetectionRestingStateFunctional_2021","container-title":"Brain Sciences","container-title-short":"Brain Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/brainsci11060741","ISSN":"2076-3425","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,3]]},"language":"en","page":"741","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Detection of Resting-State Functional Connectivity from High-Density Electroencephalography Data: Impact of Head Modeling Strategies","title-short":"Detection of Resting-State Functional Connectivity from High-Density Electroencephalography Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/11/6/741","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"tononietal_MeasuresDegeneracyRedundancy_1999","abstract":"Degeneracy, the ability of elements that are structurally different to perform the same function, is a prominent property of many biological systems ranging from genes to neural networks to evolution itself. Because structurally different elements may produce different outputs in different contexts, degeneracy should be distinguished from redundancy, which occurs when the same function is performed by identical elements. However, because of ambiguities in the distinction between structure and function and because of the lack of a theoretical treatment, these two notions often are conflated. By using information theoretical concepts, we develop here functional measures of the degeneracy and redundancy of a system with respect to a set of outputs. These measures help to distinguish the concept of degeneracy from that of redundancy and make it operationally useful. Through computer simulations of neural systems differing in connectivity, we show that degeneracy is low both for systems in which each element affects the output independently and for redundant systems in which many elements can affect the output in a similar way but do not have independent effects. By contrast, degeneracy is high for systems in which many different elements can affect the output in a similar way and at the same time can have independent effects. We demonstrate that networks that have been selected for degeneracy have high values of complexity, a measure of the average mutual information between the subsets of a system. These measures promise to be useful in characterizing and understanding the functional robustness and adaptability of biological networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Tononi","given":"Giulio"},{"family":"Sporns","given":"Olaf"},{"family":"Edelman","given":"Gerald M."}],"citation-key":"tononietal_MeasuresDegeneracyRedundancy_1999","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",3,16]]},"page":"3257-3262","PMCID":"PMC15929","PMID":"10077671","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Measures of degeneracy and redundancy in biological networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC15929/","volume":"96"},

Network neuroscience, at the level of macroscale organization of the brain, is beginning to confront the challenges associated with developing a taxonomy of its fundamental explanatory constructs. The Workgroup for HArmonized Taxonomy of NETworks (WHATNET) was formed in 2020 as an Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM)–endorsed best practices committee to provide recommendations on points of consensus, identify open questions, and highlight areas of ongoing debate in the service of moving the field toward standardized reporting of network neuroscience results. The committee conducted a survey to catalog current practices in large-scale brain network nomenclature. A few well-known network names (e.g., default mode network) dominated responses to the survey, and a number of illuminating points of disagreement emerged. We summarize survey results and provide initial considerations and recommendations from the workgroup. This perspective piece includes a selective review of challenges to this enterprise, including (1) network scale, resolution, and hierarchies; (2) interindividual variability of networks; (3) dynamics and nonstationarity of networks; (4) consideration of network affiliations of subcortical structures; and (5) consideration of multimodal information.

However, the time scales of human brain identifiability are still largely unexplored. We here investigate the dynamics of brain fingerprints along two complementary axes: (i) What is the optimal time scale at which brain fingerprints integrate information and (ii) when best identification happens. Using dynamic identifiability, we show that the best identification emerges at longer time scales; however, short transient “bursts of identifiability,” associated with neuronal activity, persist even when looking at shorter functional interactions. Furthermore, we report evidence that different parts of connectome fingerprints relate to different time scales, i.e., more visual- somatomotor at short temporal windows and more frontoparietal-DMN driven at increasing temporal windows. Last, different cognitive functions appear to be meta-analytically implicated in dynamic fingerprints across time scales.

A confounding factor is head motion. Children move more than adults, older adults more than younger adults, and patients more than controls. Head motion varies considerably among individuals within the same population. Here we explored the influence of head motion on fcMRI estimates. Mean head displacement, maximum head displacement, the number of micro movements (>0.1 mm), and head rotation were estimated in 1000 healthy, young adult subjects each scanned for two resting-state runs on matched 3T scanners. The majority of fcMRI variation across subjects was not linked to head motion. However, head motion had significant, systematic effects on fcMRI network measures. Head motion was associated with decreased functional coupling in the default and frontoparietal control networks--two networks characterized by coupling among distributed regions of association cortex. Other network measures increased with motion including estimates of local functional coupling and coupling between left and right motor regions--a region pair sometimes used as a control in studies to establish specificity. Comparisons between groups of individuals with subtly different levels of head motion yielded difference maps that could be mistaken for neuronal effects in other contexts. These effects are important to consider when interpreting variation between groups and across individuals.","author":[{"family":"Van Dijk","given":"Koene R.

  {"id":"vandijketal_IntrinsicFunctionalConnectivity_2010","abstract":"Resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) is widely used to investigate brain networks that exhibit correlated fluctuations. While fcMRI does not provide direct measurement of anatomic connectivity, accumulating evidence suggests it is sufficiently constrained by anatomy to allow the architecture of distinct brain systems to be characterized. fcMRI is particularly useful for characterizing large-scale systems that span distributed areas (e.g., polysynaptic cortical pathways, cerebro-cerebellar circuits, cortical-thalamic circuits) and has complementary strengths when contrasted with the other major tool available for human connectomics—high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We review what is known about fcMRI and then explore fcMRI data reliability, effects of preprocessing, analysis procedures, and effects of different acquisition parameters across six studies ( n = 98) to provide recommendations for optimization. Run length (2–12 min), run structure (1 12-min run or 2 6-min runs), temporal resolution (2.5 or 5.0 s), spatial resolution (2 or 3 mm), and the task (fixation, eyes closed rest, eyes open rest, continuous word-classification) were varied. Results revealed moderate to high test-retest reliability. Run structure, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution minimally influenced fcMRI results while fixation and eyes open rest yielded stronger correlations as contrasted to other task conditions. Commonly used preprocessing steps involving regression of nuisance signals minimized nonspecific (noise) correlations including those associated with respiration. The most surprising finding was that estimates of correlation strengths stabilized with acquisition times as brief as 5 min. The brevity and robustness of fcMRI positions it as a powerful tool for large-scale explorations of genetic influences on brain architecture. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of fcMRI and how it can be combined with HARDI techniques to support the emerging field of human connectomics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Dijk","given":"Koene R.

  {"id":"vanhornetal_IndividualVariabilityBrain_2008","abstract":"Functional imaging research has been heavily influenced by results based on population-level inference. However, group average results may belie the unique patterns of activity present in the individual that ordinarily are considered random noise. Recent advances in the evolution of MRI hardware have led to significant improvements in the stability and reproducibility of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) measurements. These enhancements provide a unique opportunity for closer examination of individual patterns of brain activity. Three objectives can be accomplished by considering brain scans at the individual level; (1) Mapping functional anatomy at a fine grained analysis; (2) Determining if an individual scan is normative with respect to a reference population; and (3) Understanding the sources of intersubject variability in brain activity. In this review, we detail these objectives, briefly discuss their histories and present recent trends in the analyses of individual variability. Finally, we emphasize the unique opportunities and challenges for understanding individual differences through international collaboration among Pacific Rim investigators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Horn","given":"John Darrell"},{"family":"Grafton","given":"Scott T."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Michael B."}],"citation-key":"vanhornetal_IndividualVariabilityBrain_2008","container-title":"Brain imaging and behavior","container-title-short":"Brain Imaging Behav","DOI":"10.1007/s11682-008-9049-9","ISSN":"1931-7557","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",12,1]]},"page":"327-334","PMCID":"PMC2748344","PMID":"19777073","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Individual Variability in Brain Activity: A Nuisance or an Opportunity?","title-short":"Individual Variability in Brain Activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748344/","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"venkateshetal_ComparingFunctionalConnectivity_2020","abstract":"Understanding the correlation structure associated with multiple brain measurements informs about potential “functional groupings” and network organization. The correlation structure can be conveniently captured in a matrix format that summarizes the relationships among a set of brain measurements involving two regions, for example. Such functional connectivity matrix is an important component of many types of investigation focusing on network-level properties of the brain, including clustering brain states, characterizing dynamic functional states, performing participant identification (so-called “fingerprinting”) understanding how tasks reconfigure brain networks, and inter-subject correlation analysis. In these investigations, some notion of proximity or similarity of functional connectivity matrices is employed, such as their Euclidean distance or Pearson correlation (by correlating the matrix entries). Here, we propose the use of a geodesic distance metric that reflects the underlying non-Euclidean geometry of functional correlation matrices. The approach is evaluated in the context of participant identification (fingerprinting): given a participant’s functional connectivity matrix based on resting-state or task data, how effectively can the participant be identified? Using geodesic distance, identification accuracy was over 95% on resting-state data, and exceeded the Pearson correlation approach by 20%. For whole-cortex regions, accuracy improved on a range of tasks by between 2% and as much as 20%. We also investigated identification using pairs of subnetworks (say, dorsal attention plus default mode), and particular combinations improved accuracy over whole-cortex participant identification by over 10%. The geodesic distance also outperformed Pearson correlation when the former employed a fourth of the data as the latter. Finally, we suggest that low-dimensional distance visualizations based on the geodesic approach help uncover the geometry of task functional connectivity in relation to that during resting-state. We propose that the use of the geodesic distance is an effective way to compare the correlation structure of the brain across a broad range of studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Venkatesh","given":"Manasij"},{"family":"Jaja","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Pessoa","given":"Luiz"}],"citation-key":"venkateshetal_ComparingFunctionalConnectivity_2020","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"NeuroImage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116398","ISSN":"1053-8119","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,15]]},"language":"en","page":"116398","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Comparing functional connectivity matrices: A geometry-aware approach applied to participant identification","title-short":"Comparing functional connectivity matrices","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919309899","volume":"207"},

Therefore, the ongoing activity ascribed to the different functional brain networks should also be able to reorganise and coordinate via similar mechanisms. We develop a novel method for identifying large-scale phase-coupled network dynamics and show that resting networks in magnetoencephalography are well characterised by visits to short-lived transient brain states, with spatially distinct patterns of oscillatory power and coherence in specific frequency bands. Brain states are identified for sensory, motor networks and higher-order cognitive networks. The cognitive networks include a posterior alpha (8–12 Hz) and an anterior delta/theta range (1–7 Hz) network, both exhibiting high power and coherence in areas that correspond to posterior and anterior subdivisions of the default mode network. Our results show that large-scale cortical phase-coupling networks have characteristic signatures in very specific frequency bands, possibly reflecting functional specialisation at different intrinsic timescales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Vidaurre","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Hunt","given":"Laurence T."},{"family":"Quinn","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Hunt","given":"Benjamin A.

  {"id":"vincketal_ImprovedIndexPhasesynchronization_2011","abstract":"Phase-synchronization is a manifestation of interaction between neuronal groups measurable from LFP, EEG or MEG signals, however, volume conduction can cause the coherence and the phase locking value to spuriously increase. It has been shown that the imaginary component of the coherency (ImC) cannot be spuriously increased by volume-conduction of independent sources. Recently, it was proposed that the phase lag index (PLI), which estimates to what extent the phase leads and lags between signals from two sensors are nonequiprobable, improves on the ImC. Compared to ImC, PLI has the advantage of being less influenced by phase delays. However, sensitivity to volume-conduction and noise, and capacity to detect changes in phase-synchronization, is hindered by the discontinuity of the PLI, as small perturbations turn phase lags into leads and vice versa. To solve this problem, we introduce a related index, namely the weighted phase lag index (WPLI). Differently from PLI, in WPLI the contribution of the observed phase leads and lags is weighted by the magnitude of the imaginary component of the cross-spectrum. We demonstrate two advantages of the WPLI over the PLI, in terms of reduced sensitivity to additional, uncorrelated noise sources and increased statistical power to detect changes in phase-synchronization. Another factor that can affect phase-synchronization indices is sample-size bias. We show that, when directly estimated, both PLI and the magnitude of the ImC have typically positively biased estimators. To solve this problem, we develop an unbiased estimator of the squared PLI, and a debiased estimator of the squared WPLI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Vinck","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Oostenveld","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Wingerden","given":"Marijn","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Battaglia","given":"Franscesco"},{"family":"Pennartz","given":"Cyriel M.

They are linked in general with global brain state (awake, asleep, etc.) and specifically with organisation of neuronal outputs during sensory perception and cognitive processing. Oscillations can be generated by individual neurons on the basis of interaction between inputs and intrinsic conductances but are far more commonly seen at the local network level in populations of interconnected neurons with diverse arrays of functional properties. It is at this level that the brain’s rich and diverse library of oscillatory time constants serve to temporally organise large-scale neural activity patterns. The discipline is relatively mature at the microscopic (cell, local network) level – although novel discoveries are still commonplace – but requires a far greater understanding of mesoscopic and macroscopic brain dynamics than we currently hold. Without this, extrapolation from the temporal properties of neurons and their communication strategies up to whole brain function will remain largely theoretical.

  {"id":"xiesingh_ConfidenceDistributionFrequentist_2013","abstract":"In frequentist inference, we commonly use a single point (point estimator) or an interval (confidence interval/“interval estimator”) to estimate a parameter of interest. A very simple question is: Can we also use a distribution function (“distribution estimator”) to estimate a parameter of interest in frequentist inference in the style of a Bayesian posterior? The answer is affirmative, and confidence distribution is a natural choice of such a “distribution estimator”. The concept of a confidence distribution has a long history, and its interpretation has long been fused with fiducial inference. Historically, it has been misconstrued as a fiducial concept, and has not been fully developed in the frequentist framework. In recent years, confidence distribution has attracted a surge of renewed attention, and several developments have highlighted its promising potential as an effective inferential tool.\n\nThis article reviews recent developments of confidence distributions, along with a modern definition and interpretation of the concept. It includes distributional inference based on confidence distributions and its extensions, optimality issues and their applications. Based on the new developments, the concept of a confidence distribution subsumes and unifies a wide range of examples, from regular parametric (fiducial distribution) examples to bootstrap distributions, significance (p-value) functions, normalized likelihood functions, and, in some cases, Bayesian priors and posteriors. The discussion is entirely within the school of frequentist inference, with emphasis on applications providing useful statistical inference tools for problems where frequentist methods with good properties were previously unavailable or could not be easily obtained. Although it also draws attention to some of the differences and similarities among frequentist, fiducial and Bayesian approaches, the review is not intended to re-open the philosophical debate that has lasted more than two hundred years. On the contrary, it is hoped that the article will help bridge the gaps between these different statistical procedures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Xie","given":"Min-ge"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Kesar"}],"citation-key":"xiesingh_ConfidenceDistributionFrequentist_2013","container-title":"International Statistical Review","DOI":"10.1111/insr.12000","ISSN":"1751-5823","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"es","page":"3-39","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Confidence Distribution, the Frequentist Distribution Estimator of a Parameter: A Review","title-short":"Confidence Distribution, the Frequentist Distribution Estimator of a Parameter","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/insr.12000","volume":"81"},

Hematocrit (HCT), a global hematologic marker of the amount of hemoglobin in blood, is known to impact task-evoked BOLD activation. Yet, its impact on resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) measures has not been characterized. We address this gap by testing for associations between HCT level and inter-individual variation in commonly employed R-fMRI indices of intrinsic brain function from 45 healthy adults. Given known sex differences in HCT, we also examined potential sex differences. Variation in baseline HCT among individuals were associated with regional differences in four of the six intrinsic brain indices examined. Portions of the default (anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex: ACC/MPFC), dorsal attention (intraparietal sulcus), and salience (insular and opercular cortex) network showed relationships with HCT for two measures. The relationships within MPFC, as well as visual and cerebellar networks, were modulated by sex. These results suggest that inter-individual variations in HCT can serve as a source of variations in R-fMRI derivatives at a regional level. Future work is needed to delineate whether this association is attributable to neural or non-neuronal source of variations and whether these effects are related to acute or chronic differences in HCT level.","author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Craddock","given":"R.

Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Yeo","given":"B.

Here we show that this can lead to sizable misperceptions about the implications of scientific results. Specifically, we present three pre-registered, randomized experiments where participants saw the same scientific findings visualized as showing only inferential uncertainty, only outcome variability, or both, and answered questions about the size and importance of findings they were shown. Our results, comprised of responses from medical professionals, professional data scientists, and tenure-track faculty, show that the prevalent form of visualizing only inferential uncertainty can lead to significant overestimates of treatment effects, even among highly trained experts. In contrast, we find that depicting both inferential uncertainty and outcome variability leads to more accurate perceptions of results while appearing to leave other subjective impressions of the results unchanged, on average.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Heck","given":"Patrick Ryan"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Chabris","given":"Christopher F."},{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Daniel G."},{"family":"Hofman","given":"Jake M."}],"citation-key":"zhangetal_IllusionPredictabilityScientific_2022","DOI":"10.31235/osf.io/5tcgs","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,29]]},"source":"OSF Preprints","title":"An illusion of predictability in scientific results","type":"article","URL":"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5tcgs/"},
