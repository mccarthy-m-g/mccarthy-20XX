Here, we review the problem of inefficacy in neurofeedback treatment as well as possible psychological and neurophysiological predictors for successful treatment.

  {"id":"andersonetal_ReproducibilitySingleSubjectFunctional_2011","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Measurements of resting-state functional connectivity have increasingly been used for characterization of neuropathologic and neurodevelopmental populations. We collected data to characterize how much imaging time is necessary to obtain reproducible quantitative functional connectivity measurements needed for a reliable single-subject diagnostic test.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained 100 five-minute BOLD scans on a single subject, divided into 10 sessions of 10 scans each, with the subject at rest or while watching video clips of cartoons. These data were compared with resting-state BOLD scans from 36 healthy control subjects by evaluating the correlation between each pair of 64 small spheric regions of interest obtained from a published functional brain parcellation.\nRESULTS: Single-subject and group data converged to reliable estimates of individual and population connectivity values proportional to 1 / sqrt(n). Dramatic improvements in reliability were seen by using ≤25 minutes of imaging time, with smaller improvements for additional time. Functional connectivity “fingerprints” for the individual and population began diverging at approximately 15 minutes of imaging time, with increasing reliability even at 4 hours of imaging time. Twenty-five minutes of BOLD imaging time was required before any individual connections could reliably discriminate an individual from a group of healthy control subjects. A classifier discriminating scans during which our subject was resting or watching cartoons was 95% accurate at 10 minutes and 100% accurate at 15 minutes of imaging time.\nCONCLUSIONS: An individual subject and control population converged to reliable different functional connectivity profiles that were task-modulated and could be discriminated with sufficient imaging time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"J.

  {"id":"baldassarreetal_BrainConnectivityNeurological_2016","abstract":"Purpose of review\nAn important challenge in neurology is identifying the neural mechanisms underlying behavioral deficits after brain injury. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the effects of focal brain lesions on brain networks and behavior.\n\nRecent findings\nNeuroimaging studies indicate that the human brain is organized in large-scale resting state networks (RSNs) defined via functional connectivity, that is the temporal correlation of spontaneous activity between different areas. Prior studies showed that focal brain lesion induced behaviorally relevant changes of functional connectivity beyond the site of damage. Recent work indicates that across domains, functional connectivity changes largely conform to two patterns: a reduction in interhemispheric functional connectivity and an increase in intrahemispheric functional connectivity between networks that are normally anticorrelated, for example dorsal attention and default networks. Abnormal functional connectivity can exhibit a high degree of behavioral specificity such that deficits in a given behavioral domain are selectively related to functional connectivity of the corresponding RSN, but some functional connectivity changes allow prediction across domains. Finally, as behavioral recovery proceeds, the prestroke pattern of functional connectivity is restored.\n\nSummary\nInvestigating changes in RSNs may shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying brain dysfunction after stroke. Therefore, resting state functional connectivity may represent an important tool for clinical diagnosis, tracking recovery and rehabilitation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Baldassarre","given":"Antonello"},{"family":"Ramsey","given":"Lenny E."},{"family":"Siegel","given":"Joshua S."},{"family":"Shulman","given":"Gordon L."},{"family":"Corbetta","given":"Maurizio"}],"citation-key":"baldassarreetal_BrainConnectivityNeurological_2016","container-title":"Current opinion in neurology","container-title-short":"Curr Opin Neurol","DOI":"10.1097/WCO.0000000000000396","ISSN":"1350-7540","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12]]},"page":"706-713","PMCID":"PMC5682022","PMID":"27749394","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Brain connectivity and neurological disorders after stroke","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5682022/","volume":"29"},

Conserved properties include small worldness, high efficiency of information transfer for low wiring cost, modularity, and the existence of network hubs. Structural and functional network metrics have been found to be heritable and to change with normal aging. Clinical studies, principally in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, have identified abnormalities of network configuration in patients. Future work will likely involve efforts to synthesize structural and functional networks in integrated models and to explore the interdependence of network configuration and cognitive performance.\nSUMMARY: Graph theoretical analysis of neuroimaging data is growing rapidly and could potentially provide a relatively simple but powerful quantitative framework to describe and compare whole human brain structural and functional networks under diverse experimental and clinical conditions.","author":[{"family":"Bassett","given":"Danielle S."},{"family":"Bullmore","given":"Edward T."}],"citation-key":"bassettbullmore_HumanBrainNetworks_2009","container-title":"Current Opinion in Neurology","container-title-short":"Curr Opin Neurol","DOI":"10.1097/WCO.0b013e32832d93dd","ISSN":"1473-6551","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,8]]},"language":"eng","page":"340-347","PMCID":"PMC2902726","PMID":"19494774","source":"PubMed","title":"Human brain networks in health and disease","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"betzeletal_IndividualizedEventStructure_2021","abstract":"Resting-state functional connectivity is typically modeled as the correlation structure of whole-brain regional activity. It is studied widely, both to gain insight into the brain’s intrinsic organization but also to develop markers sensitive to changes in an individual’s cognitive, clinical, and developmental state. Despite this, the origins and drivers of functional connectivity, especially at the level of densely sampled individuals, remain elusive. Here, we leverage novel methodology to decompose functional connectivity into its precise framewise contributions. Using two dense sampling datasets, we investigate the origins of individualized functional connectivity, focusing specifically on the role of brain network “events” – short-lived and peaked patterns of high-amplitude cofluctuations. Here, we develop a statistical test to identify events in empirical recordings. We show that the patterns of cofluctuation expressed during events are repeated across multiple scans of the same individual and represent idiosyncratic variants of template patterns that are expressed at the group level. Lastly, we propose a simple model of functional connectivity based on event cofluctuations, demonstrating that group-averaged cofluctuations are suboptimal for explaining participant-specific connectivity. Our work complements recent studies implicating brief instants of high-amplitude cofluctuations as the primary drivers of static, whole-brain functional connectivity. Our work also extends those studies, demonstrating that cofluctuations during events are individualized, positing a dynamic basis for functional connectivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Betzel","given":"Richard F."},{"family":"Cutts","given":"Sarah A."},{"family":"Greenwell","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Faskowitz","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Sporns","given":"Olaf"}],"citation-key":"betzeletal_IndividualizedEventStructure_2021","DOI":"10.1101/2021.03.12.435168","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,10]]},"language":"en","page":"2021.03.12.435168","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","section":"New Results","source":"bioRxiv","title":"Individualized event structure drives individual differences in whole-brain functional connectivity","type":"article","URL":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.435168v3"},

However, a number of problems with the methodology still remain--the biggest of these being how to deal with the non-independence of voxels in source space, often termed signal leakage. In this paper we demonstrate a method by which non-zero lag cortico-cortical interactions between the power envelopes of neural oscillatory processes can be reliably identified within a multivariate statistical framework. The method is spatially unbiased, moderately conservative in false positive rate and removes linear signal leakage between seed and target voxels. We demonstrate this methodology in simulation and in real MEG data. The multivariate method offers a powerful means to capture the high dimensionality and rich information content of MEG signals in a single imaging statistic. Given a significant interaction between two areas, we go on to show how classical statistical tests can be used to quantify the importance of the data features driving the interaction.","author":[{"family":"Brookes","given":"M.

  {"id":"carteretal_RestingInterhemisphericFunctional_2010","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Focal brain lesions can have important remote effects on the function of distant brain regions. The resulting network dysfunction may contribute significantly to behavioral deficits observed after stroke. This study investigates the behavioral significance of changes in the coherence of spontaneous activity in distributed networks after stroke by measuring resting state functional connectivity (FC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging.\nMETHODS: In acute stroke patients, we measured FC in a dorsal attention network and an arm somatomotor network, and determined the correlation of FC with performance obtained in a separate session on tests of attention and motor function. In particular, we compared the behavioral correlation with intrahemispheric FC to the behavioral correlation with interhemispheric FC.\nRESULTS: In the attention network, disruption of interhemispheric FC was significantly correlated with abnormal detection of visual stimuli (Pearson r with field effect = -0.624, p = 0.002). In the somatomotor network, disruption of interhemispheric FC was significantly correlated with upper extremity impairment (Pearson r with contralesional Action Research Arm Test = 0.527, p = 0.036). In contrast, intrahemispheric FC within the normal or damaged hemispheres was not correlated with performance in either network. Quantitative lesion analysis demonstrated that our results could not be explained by structural damage alone.\nINTERPRETATION: These results suggest that lesions cause state changes in the spontaneous functional architecture of the brain, and constrain behavioral output. Clinically, these results validate using FC for assessing the health of brain networks, with implications for prognosis and recovery from stroke, and underscore the importance of interhemispheric interactions.","author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"Alex R."},{"family":"Astafiev","given":"Serguei V."},{"family":"Lang","given":"Catherine E."},{"family":"Connor","given":"Lisa T."},{"family":"Rengachary","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Strube","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Pope","given":"Daniel L.

  {"id":"chanetal_LongtermPrognosisEducational_2021","abstract":"Older adults with lower education are at greater risk for dementia. It is unclear which brain changes lead to these outcomes. Longitudinal imaging-based measures of brain structure and function were examined in adult individuals (baseline age, 45–86 years; two to five visits per participant over 1–9 years). College degree completion differentiates individual-based and neighborhood-based measures of socioeconomic status and disadvantage. Older adults (~65 years and over) without a college degree exhibit a pattern of declining large-scale functional brain network organization (resting-state system segregation) that is less evident in their college-educated peers. Declining brain system segregation predicts impending changes in dementia severity, measured up to 10 years past the last scan date. The prognostic value of brain network change is independent of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related genetic risk (APOE status), the presence of AD-associated pathology (cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau, cortical amyloid) and cortical thinning. These results demonstrate that the trajectory of an individual’s brain network organization varies in relation to their educational attainment and, more broadly, is a unique indicator of individual brain health during older age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Chan","given":"Micaela Y."},{"family":"Han","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Carreno","given":"Claudia A."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ziwei"},{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"Rebekah M."},{"family":"LaRose","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Hassenstab","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Wig","given":"Gagan S."}],"citation-key":"chanetal_LongtermPrognosisEducational_2021","container-title":"Nature Aging","container-title-short":"Nat Aging","DOI":"10.1038/s43587-021-00125-4","ISSN":"2662-8465","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Alzheimer's disease;Cognitive ageing;Network models;Neural ageing\nSubject_term_id: alzheimers-disease;cognitive-ageing;network-models;neural-ageing","number":"11","page":"1053-1067","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Long-term prognosis and educational determinants of brain network decline in older adult individuals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00125-4","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"cnuddeetal_IncreasedNeuralEfficiency_2021","abstract":"Visual word recognition is a relatively effortless process, but recent research suggests the system involved is malleable, with evidence of increases in behavioural efficiency after prolonged lexical decision task (LDT) performance. However, the extent of neural changes has yet to be characterized in this context. The neural changes that occur could be related to a shift from initially effortful performance that is supported by control-related processing, to efficient task performance that is supported by domain-specific processing. To investigate this, we replicated the British Lexicon Project, and had participants complete 16 h of LDT over several days. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) at three intervals to track neural change during LDT performance and assessed event-related potentials and brain signal complexity. We found that response times decreased during LDT performance, and there was evidence of neural change through N170, P200, N400, and late positive component (LPC) amplitudes across the EEG sessions, which suggested a shift from control-related to domain-specific processing. We also found widespread complexity decreases alongside localized increases, suggesting that processing became more efficient with specific increases in processing flexibility. Together, these findings suggest that neural processing becomes more efficient and optimized to support prolonged LDT performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Cnudde","given":"Kelsey"},{"family":"Hees","given":"Sophia","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Sage"},{"family":"Wijk","given":"Gwen","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Pexman","given":"Penny M."},{"family":"Protzner","given":"Andrea B."}],"citation-key":"cnuddeetal_IncreasedNeuralEfficiency_2021","container-title":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e23030304","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3]]},"language":"en","number":"3","page":"304","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Increased Neural Efficiency in Visual Word Recognition: Evidence from Alterations in Event-Related Potentials and Multiscale Entropy","title-short":"Increased Neural Efficiency in Visual Word Recognition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/3/304","volume":"23"},

We derive functional connectivity patterns by correlating fMRI BOLD time-series, measured during movie viewing, between spatially remote cortical regions. We validate our technique extensively on real fMRI experimental data and compare our method to two state-of-the-art inter-subject registration algorithms.

However, there is great variability in the analytic pipelines typically used to derive them from rest-fMRI cohorts. Here, we consider a specific type of studies, using predictive models on the edge weights of functional connectomes, for which we highlight the best modeling choices. We systematically study the prediction performances of models in 6 different cohorts and a total of 2000 individuals, encompassing neuro-degenerative (Alzheimer's, Post-traumatic stress disorder), neuro-psychiatric (Schizophrenia, Autism), drug impact (Cannabis use) clinical settings and psychological trait (fluid intelligence). The typical prediction procedure from rest-fMRI consists of three main steps: defining brain regions, representing the interactions, and supervised learning. For each step we benchmark typical choices: 8 different ways of defining regions –either pre-defined or generated from the rest-fMRI data– 3 measures to build functional connectomes from the extracted time-series, and 10 classification models to compare functional interactions across subjects. Our benchmarks summarize more than 240 different pipelines and outline modeling choices that show consistent prediction performances in spite of variations in the populations and sites. We find that regions defined from functional data work best; that it is beneficial to capture between-region interactions with tangent-based parametrization of covariances, a midway between correlations and partial correlation; and that simple linear predictors such as a logistic regression give the best predictions. Our work is a step forward to establishing reproducible imaging-based biomarkers for clinical settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Dadi","given":"Kamalaker"},{"family":"Rahim","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Abraham","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Chyzhyk","given":"Darya"},{"family":"Milham","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Thirion","given":"Bertrand"},{"family":"Varoquaux","given":"Gaël"}],"citation-key":"dadietal_BenchmarkingFunctionalConnectomebased_2019","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"NeuroImage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.02.062","ISSN":"1053-8119","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,15]]},"language":"en","page":"115-134","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Benchmarking functional connectome-based predictive models for resting-state fMRI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919301594","volume":"192"},
  {"id":"dadietal_FinegrainAtlasesFunctional_2020","abstract":"Population imaging markedly increased the size of functional-imaging datasets, shedding new light on the neural basis of inter-individual differences. Analyzing these large data entails new scalability challenges, computational and statistical. For this reason, brain images are typically summarized in a few signals, for instance reducing voxel-level measures with brain atlases or functional modes. A good choice of the corresponding brain networks is important, as most data analyses start from these reduced signals. We contribute finely-resolved atlases of functional modes, comprising from 64 to 1024 networks. These dictionaries of functional modes (DiFuMo) are trained on millions of fMRI functional brain volumes of total size 2.4 ​TB, spanned over 27 studies and many research groups. We demonstrate the benefits of extracting reduced signals on our fine-grain atlases for many classic functional data analysis pipelines: stimuli decoding from 12,334 brain responses, standard GLM analysis of fMRI across sessions and individuals, extraction of resting-state functional-connectomes biomarkers for 2500 individuals, data compression and meta-analysis over more than 15,000 statistical maps. In each of these analysis scenarii, we compare the performance of our functional atlases with that of other popular references, and to a simple voxel-level analysis. Results highlight the importance of using high-dimensional “soft” functional atlases, to represent and analyze brain activity while capturing its functional gradients. Analyses on high-dimensional modes achieve similar statistical performance as at the voxel level, but with much reduced computational cost and higher interpretability. In addition to making them available, we provide meaningful names for these modes, based on their anatomical location. It will facilitate reporting of results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Dadi","given":"Kamalaker"},{"family":"Varoquaux","given":"Gaël"},{"family":"Machlouzarides-Shalit","given":"Antonia"},{"family":"Gorgolewski","given":"Krzysztof J."},{"family":"Wassermann","given":"Demian"},{"family":"Thirion","given":"Bertrand"},{"family":"Mensch","given":"Arthur"}],"citation-key":"dadietal_FinegrainAtlasesFunctional_2020","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"NeuroImage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117126","ISSN":"1053-8119","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"117126","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Fine-grain atlases of functional modes for fMRI analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920306121","volume":"221"},

Here we present general functional connectivity (GFC) as a method for leveraging shared features across resting-state and task fMRI and demonstrate in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Study that GFC offers better test-retest reliability than intrinsic connectivity estimated from the same amount of resting-state data alone. Furthermore, at equivalent scan lengths, GFC displayed higher estimates of heritability than resting-state functional connectivity. We also found that predictions of cognitive ability from GFC generalized across datasets, performing as well or better than resting-state or task data alone. Collectively, our work suggests that GFC can improve the reliability of intrinsic connectivity estimates in existing datasets and, subsequently, the opportunity to identify meaningful correlates of individual differences in behavior. Given that task and resting-state data are often collected together, many researchers can immediately derive more reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity through the adoption of GFC rather than solely using resting-state data.

  {"id":"finnetal_IdiosynchronySharedResponses_2020","abstract":"Two ongoing movements in human cognitive neuroscience have researchers shifting focus from group-level inferences to characterizing single subjects, and complementing tightly controlled tasks with rich, dynamic paradigms such as movies and stories. Yet relatively little work combines these two, perhaps because traditional analysis approaches for naturalistic imaging data are geared toward detecting shared responses rather than between-subject variability. Here, we review recent work using naturalistic stimuli to study individual differences, and advance a framework for detecting structure in idiosyncratic patterns of brain activity, or “idiosynchrony”. Speciﬁcally, we outline the emerging technique of inter-subject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA), including its theoretical motivation and an empirical demonstration of how it recovers brain-behavior relationships during movie watching using data from the Human Connectome Project. We also consider how stimulus choice may affect the individual signal and discuss areas for future research. We argue that naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms have the potential to reveal meaningful individual differences above and beyond those observed during traditional tasks or at rest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Finn","given":"Emily S."},{"family":"Glerean","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Khojandi","given":"Arman Y."},{"family":"Nielson","given":"Dylan"},{"family":"Molfese","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Handwerker","given":"Daniel A."},{"family":"Bandettini","given":"Peter A."}],"citation-key":"finnetal_IdiosynchronySharedResponses_2020","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"NeuroImage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116828","ISSN":"10538119","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"language":"en","page":"116828","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Idiosynchrony: From shared responses to individual differences during naturalistic neuroimaging","title-short":"Idiosynchrony","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811920303153","volume":"215"},

Primate cortico-striatal connections can be precisely mapped using invasive tract-tracing. However, noninvasive human research has not mapped these connections with anatomical precision, limited by the practice of averaging neuroimaging data across individuals. Here we utilized highly-sampled resting-state functional connectivity MRI for individually-specific precision functional mapping of cortico-striatal connections. We identified ten discrete, individual-specific subnetworks linking cortex—predominately frontal cortex—to striatum. These subnetworks included previously unknown striatal connections to the human language network. The discrete subnetworks formed a stepped rostral-caudal gradient progressing from nucleus accumbens to posterior putamen; this organization was strongest for projections from medial frontal cortex. The stepped gradient organization fit patterns of fronto-striatal connections better than a smooth, continuous gradient. Thus, precision subnetworks identify detailed, individual-specific stepped gradients of cortico-striatal connectivity that include human-specific language networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Gordon","given":"Evan M."},{"family":"Laumann","given":"Timothy O."},{"family":"Marek","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Newbold","given":"Dillan J."},{"family":"Hampton","given":"Jacqueline M."},{"family":"Seider","given":"Nicole A."},{"family":"Montez","given":"David F."},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Ashley M."},{"family":"Van","given":"Andrew N."},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Annie"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Ryland"},{"family":"Siegel","given":"Joshua S."},{"family":"Kay","given":"Benjamin P."},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Abraham Z."},{"family":"Greene","given":"Deanna J."},{"family":"Schlaggar","given":"Bradley L."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Steven E."},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Steven M."},{"family":"Dosenbach","given":"Nico U.

These systems are likely to vary spatially across individuals, even after anatomical alignment, but the characteristics of this variance are unknown. Here, we characterized large-scale brain systems across two independent datasets of young adults. In these individuals, we were able to identify brain systems that were similar to those described in the group average, and we observed that individuals had consistent topological arrangement of the system features present in the group average. However, the size of system features varied across individuals in systematic ways, such that expansion of one feature of a given system predicted expansion of other parts of the system. Individual-specific systems also contained unique topological features not present in group average systems; some of these features were consistent across a minority of individuals. These effects were observed even after controlling for data quality and for the accuracy of anatomical registration.

There is hope that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity techniques will shed light on these disruptions, providing prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers as well as targets for therapeutic interventions. However, to date, progress on clinical translation of fMRI methods has been limited. Here, we argue that this limited translation is driven by a combination of intersubject heterogeneity and the relatively low reliability of standard fMRI techniques at the individual level. We review a potential solution to these limitations: the use of new \"precision\" fMRI approaches that shift the focus of analysis from groups to single individuals through the use of extended data acquisition strategies. We begin by discussing the potential advantages of fMRI functional connectivity methods for improving our understanding of functional neuroanatomy and disruptions in psychiatric disorders. We then discuss the budding field of precision fMRI and findings garnered from this work. We demonstrate that precision fMRI can improve the reliability of functional connectivity measures, while showing high stability and sensitivity to individual differences.

We analyzed data from nine high-quality, highly sampled individuals to parse the magnitude and anatomical distribution of network variability across subjects, sessions, and tasks. Critically, we ﬁnd that functional networks are dominated by common organizational principles and stable individual features, with substantially more modest contributions from task-state and day-to-day variability.

The objective of this work is to reliably compute resting state network (RSN) topography in single participants. We trained a supervised classifier (multi-layer perceptron; MLP) to associate blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) correlation maps corresponding to pre-defined seeds with specific RSN identities. Hard classification of maps obtained from a priori seeds was highly reliable across new participants. Interestingly, continuous estimates of RSN membership retained substantial residual error. This result is consistent with the view that RSNs are hierarchically organized, and therefore not fully separable into spatially independent components. After training on a priori seed-based maps, we propagated voxel-wise correlation maps through the MLP to produce estimates of RSN membership throughout the brain. The MLP generated RSN topography estimates in individuals consistent with previous studies, even in brain regions not represented in the training data. This method could be used in future studies to relate RSN topography to other measures of functional brain organization (e.g., task-evoked responses, stimulation mapping, and deficits associated with lesions) in individuals. The multi-layer perceptron was directly compared to two alternative voxel classification procedures, specifically, dual regression and linear discriminant analysis; the perceptron generated more spatially specific RSN maps than either alternative.","author":[{"family":"Hacker","given":"Carl D."},{"family":"Laumann","given":"Timothy O."},{"family":"Szrama","given":"Nicholas P."},{"family":"Baldassarre","given":"Antonello"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Abraham Z."},{"family":"Leuthardt","given":"Eric C."},{"family":"Corbetta","given":"Maurizio"}],"citation-key":"hackeretal_RestingStateNetwork_2013","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.108","ISSN":"1095-9572","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"616-633","PMCID":"PMC3909699","PMID":"23735260","source":"PubMed","title":"Resting state network estimation in individual subjects","type":"article-journal","volume":"82"},

  {"id":"henson_WhatCanFunctional_2005","abstract":"I argue here that functional neuroimaging data--which I restrict to the haemodynamic techniques of fMRI and PET--can inform psychological theorizing, provided one assumes a \"systematic\" function-structure mapping in the brain. In this case, imaging data simply comprise another dependent variable, along with behavioural data, that can be used to test competing theories. In particular, I distinguish two types of inference: function-to-structure deduction and structure-to-function induction. With the former inference, a qualitatively different pattern of activity over the brain under two experimental conditions implies at least one different function associated with changes in the independent variable. With the second type of inference, activity of the same brain region(s) under two conditions implies a common function, possibly not predicted a priori. I illustrate these inferences with imaging studies of recognition memory, short-term memory, and repetition priming. I then consider in greater detail what is meant by a \"systematic\" function-structure mapping and argue that, particularly for structure-to-function induction, this entails a one-to-one mapping between functional and structural units, although the structural unit may be a network of interacting regions and care must be taken over the appropriate level of functional/structural abstraction. Nonetheless, the assumption of a systematic function-structure mapping is a \"working hypothesis\" that, in common with other scientific fields, cannot be proved on independent grounds and is probably best evaluated by the success of the enterprise as a whole. I also consider statistical issues such as the definition of a qualitative difference and methodological issues such as the relationship between imaging and behavioural data. I finish by reviewing various objections to neuroimaging, including neophrenology, functionalism, and equipotentiality, and by observing some criticisms of current practice in the imaging literature.","author":[{"family":"Henson","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"henson_WhatCanFunctional_2005","container-title":"The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology.

Neurobiological models of emotion dysregulation involve the fronto-limbic brain network, including in particular the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Neural variability has recently been suggested as an index of cognitive flexibility. We hypothesized that within-subject neural variability in the fronto-limbic network would be related to inter-individual variation in emotion dysregulation in the context of low affective control. In a multi-site cohort (N = 166, 93 females) of healthy individuals and individuals with emotional dysregulation (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD)), we applied partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate data-driven technique, to derive latent components yielding maximal covariance between blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability at rest and emotion dysregulation, as expressed by affective lability, depression and mania scores. PLS revealed one significant latent component (r = 0.62, p = 0.044), whereby greater emotion dysregulation was associated with increased neural variability in the amygdala, hippocampus, ventromedial, dorsomedial and dorsolateral PFC, insula and motor cortex, and decreased neural variability in occipital regions. This spatial pattern bears a striking resemblance to the fronto-limbic network, which is thought to subserve emotion regulation, and is impaired in individuals with ADHD, BD, and BPD.

However, current technologies to measure brain signals in humans have limited resolutions either in space or in time and cannot fully capture spatiotemporal variability, leaving it untested whether temporal variability and spatiotemporal synchrony are valid and reliable proxy of spatiotemporal variability in vivo. Here we used optical voltage imaging in mice under anesthesia and wakefulness to monitor cortical voltage activity at both high spatial and temporal resolutions to investigate functional connectivity (FC, a measure of spatiotemporal synchronization), Multi-Scale Entropy (MSE, a measure of temporal variability), and their relationships to Regional Entropy (RE, a measure of spatiotemporal variability). We observed that across cortical space, MSE pattern can largely explain RE pattern at small and large temporal scales with high positive and negative correlation respectively, while FC pattern strongly negatively associated with RE pattern. The time course of FC and small scale MSE tightly followed that of RE, while large scale MSE was more loosely coupled to RE. fMRI and EEG data simulated by reducing spatiotemporal resolution of the voltage imaging data or considering hemodynamics yielded MSE and FC measures that still contained information about RE based on the high resolution voltage imaging data. This suggested that MSE and FC could still be effective measures to capture spatiotemporal variability under limitation of imaging modalities applicable to human subjects. Our results support the notion that FC and MSE are effective biomarkers for brain states, and provide a promising viewpoint to unify these two principal domains in human brain data analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Mianxin"},{"family":"Song","given":"Chenchen"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yuqi"},{"family":"Knöpfel","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Changsong"}],"citation-key":"liuetal_AssessingSpatiotemporalVariability_2019","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"NeuroImage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.05.022","ISSN":"1053-8119","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"198-220","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Assessing spatiotemporal variability of brain spontaneous activity by multiscale entropy and functional connectivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919304069","volume":"198"},

However, progress in uncovering reproducible associations between individual differences in brain structure/function and behavioral phenotypes (e.g., cognition, mental health) may have been undermined by typical neuroimaging sample sizes (median N=25) 1,2. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study 3 (N=11,878), we estimated the effect sizes and reproducibility of these brain-wide associations studies (BWAS) as a function of sample size. The very largest, replicable brain-wide associations for univariate and multivariate methods were r=0.14 and r=0.34, respectively. In smaller samples, typical for brain-wide association studies (BWAS), irreproducible, inflated effect sizes were ubiquitous, no matter the method (univariate, multivariate). Until sample sizes started to approach consortium-levels, BWAS were underpowered and statistical errors assured. Multiple factors contribute to replication failures 4-6; here, we show that the pairing of small brain-behavioral phenotype effect sizes with sampling variability is a key element in wide-spread BWAS replication failure. Brain-behavioral phenotype associations stabilize and become more reproducible with sample sizes of N⪆2,000.

Currently tests of human mental abilities are modeled by cognitive constructs such as attention, working memory, and speed of information processing.

Research in neuroscience suggests that psychological processes such at perception, attention, decision and executive control are emergent properties of interacting distributed networks.

Since these statistical techniques fit models to low-dimensional measurements from brains, they ignore the fact that brain activity is high-dimensional. Here we focus on the obvious confound of common inputs: the countless unobserved variables likely have more influence than the few observed ones. Any given observed correlation can be explained by an infinite set of causal models that take into account the unobserved variables.

  {"id":"michelbrunet_EEGSourceImaging_2019","abstract":"The electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the oldest technologies to measure neuronal activity of the human brain. It has its undisputed value in clinical diagnosis, particularly (but not exclusively) in the identification of epilepsy and sleep disorders and in the evaluation of dysfunctions in sensory transmission pathways. With the advancement of digital technologies, the analysis of EEG has moved from pure visual inspection of amplitude and frequency modulations over time to a comprehensive exploration of the temporal and spatial characteristics of the recorded signals. Today, EEG is accepted as a powerful tool to capture brain function with the unique advantage of measuring neuronal processes in the time frame in which these processes occur, namely in the sub-second range. However, it is generally stated that EEG suffers from a poor spatial resolution that makes it difficult to infer to the location of the brain areas generating the neuronal activity measured on the scalp. This statement has challenged a whole community of biomedical engineers to offer solutions to localize more precisely and more reliably the generators of the EEG activity. High-density EEG systems combined with precise information of the head anatomy and sophisticated source localization algorithms now exist that convert the EEG to a true neuroimaging modality. With these tools in hand and with the fact that EEG still remains versatile, inexpensive and portable, electrical neuroimaging has become a widely used technology to study the functions of the pathological and healthy human brain. However, several steps are needed to pass from the recording of the EEG to 3-dimensional images of neuronal activity. This review explains these different steps and illustrates them in a comprehensive analysis pipeline integrated in a stand-alone freely available academic software: Cartool. The information about how the different steps are performed in Cartool is only meant as a suggestion.

The approach rests on a simple linear model that proposes the activity of a given brain region can be described by the weighted sum of its functional neighboring regions. The resulting coefficients correspond to a personalized model-based connectivity matrix that is capable of predicting the timeseries of each subject. Importantly, the model itself is subject specific and has the ability to predict an individual at a later date using a limited number of non-sequential frames. While we show that there is a significant amount of shared variance between models across subjects, the model’s ability to discriminate an individual is driven by unique connections in higher order control regions in frontal and parietal cortices.

  {"id":"mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021","abstract":"Functional connectivity of neural oscillations (oscillation-based FC) is thought to afford dynamic information exchange across task-relevant neural ensembles. Although oscillation-based FC is classically defined relative to a prestimulus baseline, giving rise to rapid, context-dependent changes in individual connections, studies of distributed spatial patterns show that oscillation-based FC is omnipresent, occurring even in the absence of explicit cognitive demands. Thus, the issue of whether oscillation-based FC is primarily shaped by cognitive state or is intrinsic in nature remains open. Accordingly, we sought to reconcile these observations by interrogating the ECoG recordings of 18 presurgical human patients (8 females) for state dependence of oscillation-based FC in five canonical frequency bands across an array of six task states. FC analysis of phase and amplitude coupling revealed a highly similar, largely state-invariant (i.e., intrinsic) spatial component across cognitive states. This spatial organization was shared across all frequency bands. Crucially, however, each band also exhibited temporally independent FC dynamics capable of supporting frequency-specific information exchange. In conclusion, the spatial organization of oscillation-based FC is largely stable over cognitive states (i.e., primarily intrinsic in nature) and shared across frequency bands. Together, our findings converge with previous observations of spatially invariant patterns of FC derived from extremely slow and aperiodic fluctuations in fMRI signals. Our observations indicate that “background” FC should be accounted for in conceptual frameworks of oscillation-based FC targeting task-related changes.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A fundamental property of neural activity is that it is periodic, enabling functional connectivity (FC) between distant regions through coupling of their oscillations. According to task-based studies, such oscillation-based FC is rapid and malleable to meet cognitive task demands. Studying distributed FC patterns instead of FC in a few individual connections, we found that oscillation-based FC is largely stable across various cognitive states and shares a common layout across oscillation frequencies. This stable spatial organization of FC in fast oscillatory brain signals parallels the known stability of fMRI-based intrinsic FC architecture. Despite the observed spatial state and frequency invariance, FC of individual connections was temporally independent between frequency bands, suggesting a putative mechanism for malleable frequency-specific FC to support cognitive tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Mostame","given":"Parham"},{"family":"Sadaghiani","given":"Sepideh"}],"citation-key":"mostamesadaghiani_OscillationBasedConnectivityArchitecture_2021","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

Neurofeedback helps individuals gain control over subtle brain activity fluctuations through real-time rewards for pre-established target brainwave frequencies at specific cortical locations. This paper reviews the effectiveness of neurofeedback in a range of conditions, including ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, substance use, PTSD, and learning difficulties. Neurofeedback has emerged as superior or equivalent to either alternative or no treatment in many of the examined studies, suggesting it produces some effects worthy of further examination. In light of its potential to address neurobiological dysfunction directly, future research is suggested in order to refine protocols, as well as to establish effectiveness and efficacy.

The idea that synchronised temporal patterns between different neural groups carries information above and beyond the isolated activity of these groups has inspired a shift in focus in the field of functional neuroimaging. Specifically, investigation into the activation elicited within certain regions by some stimulus or task has, in part, given way to analysis of patterns of co-activation or functional connectivity between distal regions. Recently, the functional connectivity community has been looking beyond the assumptions of stationarity that earlier work was based on, and has introduced methods to incorporate temporal dynamics into the analysis of connectivity. In particular, non-invasive electrophysiological data (magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (MEG/EEG)), which provides direct measurement of whole-brain activity and rich temporal information, offers an exceptional window into such (potentially fast) brain dynamics. In this review, we discuss challenges, solutions, and a collection of analysis tools that have been developed in recent years to facilitate the investigation of dynamic functional connectivity using these imaging modalities.

  {"id":"ottenetal_MotorDeficitsCorrelate_2012","abstract":"While a tumour in or abutting primary motor cortex leads to motor weakness, how tumours elsewhere in the frontal or parietal lobes affect functional connectivity in a weak patient is less clear. We hypothesized that diminished functional connectivity in a distributed network of motor centres would correlate with motor weakness in subjects with brain masses. Furthermore, we hypothesized that interhemispheric connections would be most vulnerable to subtle disruptions in functional connectivity. We used task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity to probe motor networks in control subjects and patients with brain tumours (n = 22). Using a control dataset, we developed a method for automated detection of key nodes in the motor network, including the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor area and superior parietal lobule, based on the anatomic location of the hand-motor knob in the primary motor cortex. We then calculated functional connectivity between motor network nodes in control subjects, as well as patients with and without brain masses. We used this information to construct weighted, undirected graphs, which were then compared to variables of interest, including performance on a motor task, the grooved pegboard. Strong connectivity was observed within the identified motor networks between all nodes bilaterally, and especially between the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area. Reduced connectivity was observed in subjects with motor weakness versus subjects with normal strength (P < 0.001). This difference was driven mostly by decreases in interhemispheric connectivity between the primary motor cortices (P < 0.05) and between the left primary motor cortex and the right premotor area (P < 0.05), as well as other premotor area connections. In the subjects without motor weakness, however, performance on the grooved pegboard did not relate to interhemispheric connectivity, but rather was inversely correlated with connectivity between the left premotor area and left supplementary motor area, for both the left and the right hands (P < 0.01). Finally, two subjects who experienced severe weakness following surgery for their brain tumours were followed longitudinally, and the subject who recovered showed reconstitution of her motor network at follow-up. The subject who was persistently weak did not reconstitute his motor network. Motor weakness in subjects with brain tumours that do not involve primary motor structures is associated with decreased connectivity within motor functional networks, particularly interhemispheric connections. Motor networks become weaker as the subjects become weaker, and may become strong again during motor recovery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Otten","given":"Marc L."},{"family":"Mikell","given":"Charles B."},{"family":"Youngerman","given":"Brett E."},{"family":"Liston","given":"Conor"},{"family":"Sisti","given":"Michael B."},{"family":"Bruce","given":"Jeffrey N."},{"family":"Small","given":"Scott A."},{"family":"McKhann","given":"Guy M."}],"citation-key":"ottenetal_MotorDeficitsCorrelate_2012","container-title":"Brain","container-title-short":"Brain","DOI":"10.1093/brain/aws041","ISSN":"0006-8950","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,4]]},"page":"1017-1026","PMCID":"PMC3326259","PMID":"22408270","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Motor deficits correlate with resting state motor network connectivity in patients with brain tumours","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3326259/","volume":"135"},

The answer to this question necessitates characterizing the mapping between structure and function. The aim of this paper is to discuss broad issues surrounding the link between structure and function in the brain that will motivate a network perspective to understanding this question. However, as others in the past, I argue that a network perspective should supplant the common strategy of understanding the brain in terms of individual regions. Whereas this perspective is needed for a fuller characterization of the mind-brain, it should not be viewed as panacea. For one, the challenges posed by the many-to-many mapping between regions and functions is not dissolved by the network perspective. Although the problem is ameliorated, one should not anticipate a one-to-one mapping when the network approach is adopted. Furthermore, decomposition of the brain network in terms of meaningful clusters of regions, such as the ones generated by community-finding algorithms, does not by itself reveal \"true\" subnetworks. Given the hierarchical and multi-relational relationship between regions, multiple decompositions will offer different \"slices\" of a broader landscape of networks within the brain. Finally, I described how the function of brain regions can be characterized in a multidimensional manner via the idea of diversity profiles. The concept can also be used to describe the way different brain regions participate in networks.","author":[{"family":"Pessoa","given":"Luiz"}],"citation-key":"pessoa_UnderstandingBrainNetworks_2014","container-title":"Physics of Life Reviews","container-title-short":"Phys Life Rev","DOI":"10.1016/j.plrev.2014.03.005","ISSN":"1873-1457","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"400-435","PMCID":"PMC4157099","PMID":"24819881","source":"PubMed","title":"Understanding brain networks and brain organization","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"rolandzilles_StructuralDivisionsFunctional_1998","abstract":"The question of what is a cortical area needs a thorough definition of borders both in the microstructural and the functional domains. Microstructural parcellation of the human cerebral cortex should be made on multiple criteria based on quantitative measurements of microstructural variables, such as neuron densities, neurotransmitter receptor densities, enzyme densities, etc. Because of the inter-individual variations of extent and topography of microstructurally defined areas, the final microstructurally defined areas appear as population maps. In the functional domain, columns, patches and blobs signifying synaptically active parts of the cortex appear as cortical functional fields. These fields are the largest functional entities of the cerebral cortex according to the cortical field hypothesis. In its strong version, the cortical field hypothesis postulates that all neurons and synapses within the fields perform a co-operative computation. A number of such fields together provide the functional contribution of the cerebral cortex. The functional parcellation of the human cerebral cortex must be based on field population maps, which after intersection analysis appear as functional domains. The major structural-functional hypothesis to be examined is whether these functional domains are equi-territorial to the microstructurally defined meta-maps. The cortical hypothesis predicts that, if two brain tasks make use of one or several identical or largely overlapping fields, they cannot be performed simultaneously without errors or increases in latency. Evidence for such interference is presented. This evidence represents a restriction in the parallel processing of the human brain. In the posterior part of the brain not only visual cortical areas may qualify for parallel processing, but also the somatosensory cortices appear to have separate functional streams for the detection of microgeometry and macrogeometry.","author":[{"family":"Roland","given":"P.

  {"id":"saucematzel_CausesVariationLearning_2013","abstract":"In a seminal paper written five decades ago, Cronbach discussed the two highly distinct approaches to scientific psychology: experimental and correlational. Today, although these two approaches are fruitfully implemented and embraced across some fields of psychology, this synergy is largely absent from other areas, such as in the study of learning and behavior. Both Tolman and Hull, in a rare case of agreement, stated that the correlational approach held little promise for the understanding of behavior. Interestingly, this dismissal of the study of individual differences was absent in the biologically-oriented branches of behavior analysis, namely, behavioral genetics and ethology. Here we propose that the distinction between “causation” and “causes of variation” (with its origins in the field of genetics) reveal the potential value of the correlational approach in understanding the full complexity of learning and behavior. Although the experimental approach can illuminate the causal variables that modulate learning, the analysis of individual differences can elucidate how much and in which way variables interact to support variations in learning in complex natural environments. For example, understanding that a past experience with a stimulus influences its “associability” provides little insight into how individual predispositions interact to modulate this influence on associability. In this “new” light, we discuss examples from studies of individual differences in animals’ performance in the Morris Water Maze and from our own work on individual differences in general intelligence in mice. These studies illustrate that, opposed to what Underwood famously suggested, studies of individual differences can do much more to psychology than merely providing preliminary indications of cause-effect relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Sauce","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Matzel","given":"Louis D."}],"citation-key":"saucematzel_CausesVariationLearning_2013","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

A consistent task-specific activation in all nine subjects was detected in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex at an average movement rate of 3.2 Hz reached after practice. This corresponded to a significant increase of the mean rCBF in the left primary sensorimotor cortex in spatially standardised and averaged PET images. Additional task-specific activation sites detected by individual analysis were found in the lateral and medial premotor, parietal, and cingulate areas, and in subcortical structures including the basal ganglia of both cerebral hemispheres. These activations showed no or little spatial overlap from subject to subject, thus being obscured in the analysis of pooled data. The observed activity patterns were related to movement rate and accuracy in individual subjects.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) are techniques suited to capture these interactions, because they provide whole head measurements of brain activity in the millisecond range. More than one sensor picks up the activity of an underlying source. This field spread severely limits the utility of connectivity measures computed directly between sensor recordings. Consequentially, neuronal interactions should be studied on the level of the reconstructed sources. This article reviews several methods that have been applied to investigate interactions between brain regions in source space. We will mainly focus on the different measures used to quantify connectivity, and on the different strategies adopted to identify regions of interest. Despite various successful accounts of MEG and EEG source connectivity, caution with respect to the interpretation of the results is still warranted. This is due to the fact that effects of field spread can never be completely abolished in source space. However, in this very exciting and developing field of research this cautionary note should not discourage researchers from further investigation into the connectivity between neuronal sources.","author":[{"family":"Schoffelen","given":"Jan-Mathijs"},{"family":"Gross","given":"Joachim"}],"citation-key":"schoffelengross_SourceConnectivityAnalysis_2009","container-title":"Human Brain Mapping","container-title-short":"Hum Brain Mapp","DOI":"10.1002/hbm.20745","ISSN":"1097-0193","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,6]]},"language":"eng","page":"1857-1865","PMCID":"PMC6870611","PMID":"19235884","source":"PubMed","title":"Source connectivity analysis with MEG and EEG","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

Building on these studies, we ask whether distributions of network variants reflect stable, trait-like differences in brain organization. Across several datasets of highly-sampled individuals we show that 1) variants are highly stable within individuals, 2) variants are found in characteristic locations and associate with characteristic functional networks across large groups, 3) task-evoked signals in variants demonstrate a link to functional variation, and 4) individuals cluster into subgroups on the basis of variant characteristics that are related to differences in behavior.

  {"id":"stametal_PhaseLagIndex_2007","abstract":"Objective: To address the problem of volume conduction and active reference electrodes in the assessment of functional connectivity, we propose a novel measure to quantify phase synchronization, the phase lag index (PLI), and compare its performance to the well-known phase coherence (PC), and to the imaginary component of coherency (IC). Methods: The PLI is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of phase differences between two signals. The performance of PLI, PC, and IC was examined in (i) a model of 64 globally coupled oscillators, (ii) an EEG with an absence seizure, (iii) an EEG data set of 15 Alzheimer patients and 13 control subjects, and (iv) two MEG data sets. Results: PLI and PC were more sensitive than IC to increasing levels of true synchronization in the model. PC and IC were influenced stronger than PLI by spurious correlations because of common sources. All measures detected changes in synchronization during the absence seizure. In contrast to PC, PLI and IC were barely changed by the choice of different montages. PLI and IC were superior to PC in detecting changes in beta band connectivity in AD patients. Finally, PLI and IC revealed a different spatial pattern of functional connectivity in MEG data than PC. Conclusion: The PLI performed at least as well as the PC in detecting true changes in synchronization in model and real data but, at the same token and like-wise the IC, it was much less affected by the influence of common sources and active reference electrodes.

  {"id":"tieetal_DefiningLanguageNetworks_2014","abstract":"Presurgical language mapping for patients with lesions close to language areas is critical to neurosurgical decision-making for preservation of language function. As a clinical noninvasive imaging technique, functional MRI (fMRI) is used to identify language areas by measuring blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal change while patients perform carefully timed language vs. control tasks. This task-based fMRI critically depends on task performance, excluding many patients who have difficulty performing language tasks due to neurologic deficits. On the basis of recent discovery of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), we propose a \"task-free\" paradigm acquiring fMRI data when patients simply are at rest. This paradigm is less demanding for patients to perform and easier for technologists to administer. We investigated the feasibility of this approach in right-handed healthy control subjects. First, group independent component analysis (ICA) was applied on the training group (14 subjects) to identify group level language components based on expert rating results. Then, four empirically and structurally defined language network templates were assessed for their ability to identify language components from individuals' ICA output of the testing group (18 subjects) based on spatial similarity analysis. Results suggest that it is feasible to extract language activations from rs-fMRI at the individual subject level, and two empirically defined templates (that focuses on frontal language areas and that incorporates both frontal and temporal language areas) demonstrated the best performance. We propose a semi-automated language component identification procedure and discuss the practical concerns and suggestions for this approach to be used in clinical fMRI language mapping.","author":[{"family":"Tie","given":"Yanmei"},{"family":"Rigolo","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Norton","given":"Isaiah H."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Raymond Y."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Wentao"},{"family":"Orringer","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Mukundan","given":"Srinivasan"},{"family":"Golby","given":"Alexandra J."}],"citation-key":"tieetal_DefiningLanguageNetworks_2014","container-title":"Human Brain Mapping","container-title-short":"Hum Brain Mapp","DOI":"10.1002/hbm.22231","ISSN":"1097-0193","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3]]},"language":"eng","page":"1018-1030","PMCID":"PMC3683367","PMID":"23288627","source":"PubMed","title":"Defining language networks from resting-state fMRI for surgical planning--a feasibility study","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},

Using dynamic identifiability, we show that the best identification emerges at longer time scales; however, short transient “bursts of identifiability,” associated with neuronal activity, persist even when looking at shorter functional interactions. Furthermore, we report evidence that different parts of connectome fingerprints relate to different time scales, i.e., more visual- somatomotor at short temporal windows and more frontoparietal-DMN driven at increasing temporal windows. Last, different cognitive functions appear to be meta-analytically implicated in dynamic fingerprints across time scales.

  {"id":"zanescoetal_BetweenpersonCorrelatesTemporal_2020","abstract":"Microstates reflect transient brain states resulting from the synchronous activity of brain networks that predominate in the broadband EEG. There has been increasing interest in how the functional organization of the brain varies across individuals, or the extent to which its spatiotemporal dynamics are state dependent. However, little research has examined within and between-person correlates of microstate temporal parameters in healthy populations. In the present study, neuroelectric activity recorded during eyes-closed rest and during simple visual fixation was segmented into a time series of transient microstate intervals. It was found that five data-driven microstate configurations explained the preponderance of topographic variance in the EEG time series of the 374 recordings (from 187 participants) included in the study. We observed that the temporal dynamics of microstates varied within individuals to a greater degree than they differed between persons, with within-person factors explaining a large portion of the variance in mean microstate duration and occurrence rate. Nevertheless, several individual differences were found to predict the temporal dynamics of microstates. Of these, age and gender were the most reliable. These findings not only suggest that the rich temporal dynamics of whole-brain neuronal networks vary considerably within individuals, but that microstates appear to differentiate persons based on trait individual differences. Rather than focusing exclusively on between-person differences in microstates as measures of brain function, researchers should turn their attention towards understanding the factors contributing to within-person variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zanesco","given":"Anthony P."},{"family":"King","given":"Brandon G."},{"family":"Skwara","given":"Alea C."},{"family":"Saron","given":"Clifford D."}],"citation-key":"zanescoetal_BetweenpersonCorrelatesTemporal_2020","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"NeuroImage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116631","ISSN":"1053-8119","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"116631","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Within and between-person correlates of the temporal dynamics of resting EEG microstates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381192030118X","volume":"211"},
  {"id":"zhangetal_PreoperativeSensorimotorMapping_2009","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To describe initial experience with resting-state correlation mapping as a potential aid for presurgical planning of brain tumor resection.\nMETHODS: Resting-state blood oxygenation-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were acquired in 17 healthy young adults and 4 patients with brain tumors invading sensorimotor cortex. Conventional fMRI motor mapping (finger-tapping protocol) was also performed in the patients. Intraoperatively, motor hand area was mapped using cortical stimulation.\nRESULTS: Robust and consistent delineation of sensorimotor cortex was obtained using the resting-state blood oxygenation-dependent data. Resting-state functional mapping localized sensorimotor areas consistent with cortical stimulation mapping and in all patients performed as well as or better than task-based fMRI.\nCONCLUSION: Resting-state correlation mapping is a promising tool for reliable functional localization of eloquent cortex. This method compares well with \"gold standard\" cortical stimulation mapping and offers several advantages compared with conventional motor mapping fMRI.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Dongyang"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"James M."},{"family":"Fox","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Leuthardt","given":"Eric C."},{"family":"Grubb","given":"Robert L."},{"family":"Chicoine","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Smyth","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Abraham Z."},{"family":"Raichle","given":"Marcus E."},{"family":"Shimony","given":"Joshua S."}],"citation-key":"zhangetal_PreoperativeSensorimotorMapping_2009","container-title":"Neurosurgery","container-title-short":"Neurosurgery","DOI":"10.1227/01.NEU.0000350868.95634.CA","ISSN":"1524-4040","issue":"6 Suppl","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,12]]},"language":"eng","page":"226-236","PMCID":"PMC2796594","PMID":"19934999","source":"PubMed","title":"Preoperative sensorimotor mapping in brain tumor patients using spontaneous fluctuations in neuronal activity imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging: initial experience","title-short":"Preoperative sensorimotor mapping in brain tumor patients using spontaneous fluctuations in neuronal activity imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging","type":"article-journal","volume":"65"}
