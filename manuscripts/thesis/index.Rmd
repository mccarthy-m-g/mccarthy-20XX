abstract          : |
  The study of network variants, individual-specific deviations in whole brain functional network organization, is an area of growing interest in human neuroscience due to its relevance for understanding *how much* and *in which ways* whole brain functional networks differ between and within individuals. Although previous research has mainly relied on highly sampled functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to study network variants, electroencephalography (EEG) has the potential to deliver complimentary insights given that it directly measures the electrophysiological activity of neural populations in the cerebral cortex in real time. Here we explored the feasibility of using EEG to study network variants using repeated measures eyes-closed and eyes-open resting state data from 14 participants taken across three sessions---testing for the presence of network variants by estimating how phase and amplitude coupling functional connectomes differ between and within individuals across different frequency bands using measures of network similarity, contrasting the magnitude of each of these effects across sessions and states at the group-level, and examining their consistency at the individual-level. We found at most weak supportive evidence for the presence of network variants in a subset of our sample for phase coupling functional connectomes in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands, but did not generally demonstrate the feasibility of using EEG to study network variants given the inconsistencies observed across participants.
