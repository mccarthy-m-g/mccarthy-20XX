# Python Scripts

Please note that these scripts are not used anywhere in the analysis. These were used interactively during the initial preprocessing stages of the project, but were later rewritten in R using the **reticulate** packages so they could be better integrated with the **targets** pipeline. The only exception is the `pli.py` script containing the function for the Hilbert transform Phase Lag Index---this function is sourced with reticulate in the targets pipeline.
